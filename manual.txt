THERMAL RUNAWAY

Definition
Refers to a situation where the chemical
condition and the temperature within a battery
cell are such that heat is generated faster than
it can be dissipated, resulting in a chain
reaction where the rising cell temperature
accelerates the chemical reaction in the battery
and destroys it. The thermal runaway event is
often associated with the release of significant
quantities of smoke, gases, and heat (in
excess of 600 Degrees Celsius), as well as the

29 / 845

potential for resulting fire, explosion, and/or the
release of flammable electrolyte material as
well as miscellaneous shrapnel from the
device.
TUC

Time of Useful Consciousness is described as

1.1.8 BLOOD DONATION
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1
8.2.1

In a completely healthy individual, the fluid reduction caused by donating one unit of blood is replaced within several
hours. In some people however, the loss of blood causes disturbances to the circulation which may last for several days.
While the effects at ground level are minimal, flying during this period may entail a risk. Generally, active crew members
should not donate blood. However, if they do they should not fly for a period of 48 hours.

31 / 845

1.1.9 SCUBA DIVING
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1
8.3.1

Although normally, decompression sickness does not occur below 20,000 feet ASL (6090 M.), people who fly after scuba
diving may develop the symptoms at much lower altitudes.
Atmospheric pressure beneath the water increases by one atmosphere for every 33 Feet (10 M.) and divers who breathe
pressurized air for more than a few minutes supersaturate their tissues with nitrogen.
For this reason as the a/c ascends, nitrogen bubble formation may take place above 8000 Feet ASL (2,432 M.) causing
the bends.
After non-decompression dives, flights up to altitudes of 8,000 Feet ASL (2432 M.) should be avoided for 12 hours.
Where decompression stops have been required on returning to the surface, the interval should be 24 hours.
For actual flights above 8,000 Feet ASL (2432 M.) the interval is 24 hours regardless of the type of dive, even
pressurized a/c may lose cabin pressure.

32 / 845

1.1.10 EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL // DRUGS ON CREW MEMBERS AT ALTITUDE
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1
8.4.1, 8.4.2

Alcohol:
Never fly while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Flight crews are prohibited from consuming alcoholic beverages
while on duty, while on standby or within 12 hours of reporting for duty or standby. Flight crews are prohibited from acting
as crew members while under the influence of alcohol.
Alcohol is selectively concentrated by the body into certain areas and remains in the fluid of the inner ear even after all
traces of alcohol in the blood have disappeared. This accounts for the difficulty in balance that is experienced in a
hangover. Even small amounts of alcohol (0.5%) have been shown in simulators to reduce piloting skills.
The effect of alcohol and hypoxia is additive, and at 6,000 Feet ASL (1829 M.), the effect of one drink is equivalent to two
drinks at sea level. The body metabolizes alcohol at a fixed rate.
ALCOHOL AND FLYING DO NOT MIX // YOU ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT FIT FOR DUTY
Drugs:
As per CAR 602.03 No person shall act as a crew member of an a/c while using any drug that impairs the person’s
faculties to the extent that the safety of the aircraft or of persons on board the aircraft is endangered in any way.
The use of any drugs, including tranquillizers, sedatives, antibiotics, pain killers and cold remedies can be dangerous and
is prohibited.
Self- medication or taking medicine in any form immediately before or while flying can be hazardous. Simple remedies,
such as antihistamines, cough and cold mixtures, laxatives, tranquilizers and appetite suppressants may seriously impair
the judgment and coordination needed by the air crew. The condition for which the medicine is required may itself reduce
a crew’s efficiency to a dangerous level, even though the symptoms are masked by medicine.
Unless cleared by an aviation medical examiner, air crew should not fly under the influence of prescription or over-thecounter drugs any more than they should fly under the influence of alcohol.
F/A’s having any medical condition requiring specific drug therapy must receive written approval from a physician prior to
flying. This approval must indicate that the prescribed drugs will not interfere with their job performance.
Certain drugs have been associated with a/c accidents in the recent past. The most common of these are:
Antihistamines ~ ~ Widely prescribed for hay fever and other allergies and contained in many cold and cough
remedies.
Tranquilizers ~ ~ ~ Prescribed for nervous condition, hypertension and other conditions.
Amphetamines ~ ~ Appetite reducing drugs.
Barbiturates ~ ~ ~ ~ Nerve tonics or pills prescribed for digestive and other disorders may produce a marked

33 / 845

depression of mental alertness.
Anesthetics ~ ~ ~ ~Air crew members should not fly for at least 24 hours after receiving any type of general or local
anesthetics. i.e: Dental oral surgery and / or Day surgical treatments.

Pre-flight checks must be completed for the a/c exterior and interior. This helps to ensure that Company Safety Policies
and Regulatory responsibilities are not compromised. This includes a physical inspection of specified equipment and
furnishings conducted by all F/A’s and Flight Crew members.
Once on board the a/c all F/A’s shall perform pre-flight serviceability checks for their designated zones. (Rows 10 to 14
for ICFA and Rows 1 to 9 for # 2 F/A DHC-7) When all checks are completed, the ICFA will inform the PIC during the
pre-flight briefing of any irregularities identified during the checks. On the DHC-8, all preflight checks are the
responsibility of the solo flight attendant.
It is also the responsibility of the F/A’s to continuously monitor items for unserviceability throughout the day.
Many types of equipment are carried on board the a/c for use in a possible emergency. It is the individual
responsibility of each F/A to know the equipment, how it works, and where it is located on the a/c, regardless of
their assigned position(s).
A pre-flight check of safety and emergency equipment is to be completed at the commencement of each duty day for the
a/c you have been assigned as crew on.
Normally, this would be the only time the a/c would require this check. The exceptions are in the following sections below.

2.1 Daily Duties & Safety Procedures
4.7, 4.7.2

CAR 705.45
The PIC of an a/c that is equipped with a F/D door shall ensure that the door is locked at all times from the moment the
passenger entry doors are closed in preparation for departure until they are opened on arrival.
The F/D door is closed and locked by the Captain using a locking device only accessible from within the F/D,
Because our DHC-7 F/D door is not equipped with a key pad it can only be opened from inside the flight compartment.
The Captain is responsible for the locking of the F/D door; however he/she may direct the F/O to lock the F/D door.
The door may be unlocked and opened when crew members and other authorized persons are required to exit or enter
the flight deck in the performance of their duties, for physiological needs or for overriding concerns related to the safety of
the flight.
If a flight crew member leaves the flight deck, the F/A or other authorized person (as per FAM 2.37.0) must enter the flight
deck and remain there with the door locked until the crew member returns;
Note: If only one F/A is o/b the aeroplane and no other authorized person is o/b, the one F/A is not required to go
to the F/D.
When the crew member returns to the flight deck, he / she will knock on the flight deck door and the F/A, or other
authorized person will look through the viewing port window to ensure the identification before opening;
Note: Flight crew will not vacate the flight deck without first contacting the F/A with their intentions. At no time
should the F/D door be opened during the flight without the previously mentioned communication;
The F/A will ensure that there are no passengers standing in the aisle around the flight deck entrance when flight crew
leave or enter the F/D; and
The F/A will minimize the view of the F/D entrance by the use of curtains, when equipped, whenever the F/D door is
opened.

2. DAILY DUTIES & SAFTY PROCEDURES
2.1 Daily Duties & Safety Procedures
4.6.3, 4.7, 4.7.2

The door will only be opened after receiving the agreed upon password from the flight attendant over the interphone. This
password will be chosen during the crew pre-flight briefing. Should the interphone be u/s the alternate security knock for
access (also chosen during the pre-flight briefing) shall be used. Crews are reminded to change their password and
security knocks frequently to avoid frequent flyers determining the secret codes.
Note: The flight deck door will be opened on the ground at the completion of the flight after the passenger door
has been opened.

2.1.94 STERILE FLIGHT DECK
2. DAILY DUTIES & SAFTY PROCEDURES
2.1 Daily Duties & Safety Procedures
4.8, 4.8.1, 4.8.2, 4.8.3

The Sterile Flight Deck is a CAR requiring pilots to refrain from non-essential activities and non- operational conversations
during the critical phases of flight, normally below 10,000 feet.
During the critical phases of flight (Taxi out, T/O, Initial Climb, Approach, Landing and Taxi in) it is imperative that
procedures of the flight deck crew are undisturbed. Do not interrupt the reading of the checklists at any time as
missed checklist items could affect the safe operation of the flight.
During these sterile periods there will be no communication between the cabin and flight deck unless initiated by the PIC
or the F/A detects an obvious emergency situation exists.
The F/A will not attempt to contact or enter the F/D until the Fasten Seat Belt sign has been turned off or advised by the
Captain.
For approach and landing once the cabin is secure and the signal has been received, the F/A must not call the F/D until
the a/c has landed and the seat belt sign is turned off.
Once the final approach signal has been given by the Captain, the F/A must not call the F/D until the a/c has landed and
the seat belt sign has been turned “OFF”.
In the event of an emergency after the landing or take-off signal has been given, the F/A must use his/her judgment
whether a critical emergency exists and how to advise the F/D crew.
The following situations are to be used as guidance:
If an emergency has been recognized prior to the initiation of the take-off roll, the ICFA should immediately notify the
F/D and advise of the specific emergency (i.e.fire).
If the take-off roll has commenced, the warning should be held until the a/c is airborne;

In the event of an emergency on descent, the ICFA should advise the flight deck crew, taking care that radio or
check list flow is not interrupted; and,
If landing is imminent and an emergency develops, the ICFA should remain seated until the a/c has landed and
slowed to taxi before advising the F/D crew.

Note: It is not possible to design a response for every situation, therefore, it is expected that common sense will
prevail.

6.8, 6.8.1

The PA system is used by either the F/D or Cabin crew to make announcements to the pax.
Considerable advantage can be gained in passenger relations and goodwill by the discreet use of the Public Address
(PA) System.
1. The ICFA must ensure that all required safety announcements are made.
2. In-flight service announcements may be delegated by the ICFA.
3. The Captain’s announcements will generally deal with position reports, delays on arrival or departures, unusual
flight conditions, and emergencies.

3. COMMUNICATIONS & ANNOUNCMENTS
3.1 Communications & Announcements
6.8, 6.8.1, 10.1, 10.1.1 (b)

(Reference Chapter 12 for PA Operation on the DHC-8)
The Public Address system enables the Captain and F/A’s to make announcements with specific instruction pertaining to
the flight, abnormal or emergency briefings and any other items which may be of interest to the passengers.
The use of the PA system is through the interphone. You must press the “PA ON” button before using the PA for
announcements and press “PA CANCEL” upon completion.

Flight Attendants are to be alert for and listen to all announcements given by the Flight Deck. These announcements may
contain information important to the F/A’s or even emergency signals and urgent communications. Pax possibly may
have missed the announcement from the Flight Deck and they may ask you what was just announced?
The Flight Deck cannot clearly hear their announcements into the cabin. If the announcements are inaudible or the
system is faulty, report it to the PIC promptly and obtain clarification.
NOTE: The F/D PA System overrides the Cabin PA System. The F/D crew may interrupt the F/A’s PA
announcements at any time. This occurs simply by the F/D crew lifting their handset which causes relays to be
de-energized, disconnecting the cabin handsets from the PA amplifier.
The F/D has a “PA IN USE” light and switch to arm or disarm the PA system and a “PA WARNING” light which comes
on when the F/D crew has armed the PA system.
The “PA IN USE” light comes on when the F/D crew has lifted either handset off of its holder and armed the PA system,

171 / 845

or when the F/A has lifted either of the handsets off of its holder and armed the PA system by pressing the momentaryaction “PA ON” switch.
The Cabin PA panel contains switches to arm or disarm the PA system and a “PA WARNING” light labeled ON that
illuminates when the F/A has armed the PA system.
At the end of the announcements the crew disarms the PA system by pressing the momentary-action “PA CANCEL”
switch or replacing the handset back into the holder. The system is now reset for use as either service interphone or as a
PA.

4. SAFETY BRIEFINGS & SPAT PROCEDURES
4.1 Safety Briefings & Spat Procedures

Communication is an integral part of any Flight Deck and Cabin crew member. The importance of effective Flight Deck //
Cabin Crew communication and coordination cannot be overemphasized.
Air Tindi expects all crew members to take a CREW RESOURSE MANAGEMENT approach to communications in
respect to the entire crew acting in unison.
Right from the time a crew member checks in for the duty day, until its completion, the crew member has an obligation
to be a part of a very important TEAM!
This TEAM will be responsible to coordinate all actions with regard to the safety of the pax and the a/c. This process in no
way changes or diminishes the PIC’s authority, however all crew members input are considered in the final decision.
This step helps to ensure all crew are of the same understanding as to the appropriate procedures to take in the event of
an abnormality.

4. SAFETY BRIEFINGS & SPAT PROCEDURES
4.1 Safety Briefings & Spat Procedures
4.14, 4.14.1, 4.14.3, 4.14.4, 4.18, 4.18.5

Many flights have a diverse pax load and some pax may require more help or assistance than others. These pax are
referred to as “Special Need Pax” and they should be pre-boarded to permit easy identification and proper seating
requirements. “Special Need Pax” must never occupy a seat in an emergency exit row or where they could block access
to emergency equipment. Generally SPATS will be seated in a window seat that is not in an exit row.
On the DHC-7, the only exception to this policy is for wheelchair passengers. Providing the a/c is not at full pax
occupancy, they may sit in 11B, 11C, 12B, or 12C which are aisle seats. This assists them for ease of evacuation and for
access to the washrooms. When any of these seats are occupied by a pax in a wheelchair, no one else can occupy the
window seat next to them. If at full pax occupancy, the wheelchair pax will sit in 11A, 11D, 12A or 12D. These seats are
also equipped with Braille Seat Identifiers to assist blind pax’s when occupying one of these seats.
On the DHC-8, special passengers should be seated at the front of the aircraft for access to the lavatory and floor level
exits except for row 1 CD.
Individual safety briefings should be given to all Special Need Passengers (SPATS). Those who are blind or who have
identifiable hearing problems, speak a foreign language or those who may need special assistance such as parents with
infants or children, elderly, unaccompanied minor, law enforcement officers with prisoners or deportees to name a few.
The purpose of the Special Need Passenger Briefing is to maximize their ability to respond to emergency
situations. These briefings are provided on a one –to-one basis and F/A’s are to ensure they are provided when the pax
consents to it. A pax may decline an individual safety briefing.
These briefings must be conducted at the pax originating station or when there has been a change of a/c.
The individual safety briefing should include any information contained in the standard safety briefing and the safety
features card that the passenger would not be able to receive during the normal conduct of that safety briefing, and
additional information applicable to the needs of that person as follows:
The most appropriate brace position for that passenger in consideration of his/ her condition, injury, stature, and/or
seat orientation and pitch;
Location to place any service animal that accompanies the passenger; and
If we had to leave the a/c quickly how can I best assist you?

4.1.57 PARALYZED PAX
4. SAFETY BRIEFINGS & SPAT PROCEDURES
4.1 Safety Briefings & Spat Procedures
4.14, 4.14.1

When communicating – sit or kneel so that eye contact is easily maintained. You should always try to maintain a relaxed,
unhurried approach.
If speech or understanding seem affected:
Speak slowly in simple phrases.
Use gestures (a nod or shake of the head is all that is required in some instances).

Care should be taken when seating or handling paralyzed pax. A minor brush or bump may result in a “pressure
sore” which could cause the pax serious problems if gone undetected. Always advise the pax immediately of a
minor brush or bump.
Paralyzed pax may have no bladder control and may use a “leg bag” to collect urine. The “leg bag” may be
noticeable during a wheelchair transfer and should not be commented on.

When briefing, determine the pax’s extent of paralysis first in order to provide appropriate instructions.
Care should be taken when handling hot food and beverages.
Burns and abrasions can occur frequently as paralyzed pax’s may not be able to distinguish between hot or cold

QUADRIPLEGICS:
Total paralysis of the body from the neck down
Quadriplegics are sensitive to temperature. Body heat will adjust to ambient heat / cold and sweat mechanism does
not function.
Always ask a quadriplegic how they handle heat / cold.
If necessary cool down the pax or offer blankets for warmth.

PARAPLEGICS:
Motor and sensory paralysis of the entire lower half of the body
HEMIPLEGICS:

302 / 845

One side of the body is paralyzed (may have an artificial limb or have an arm or a leg in a cast).
Pax who have a disability affecting one side of the body will be seated in an aisle seat with the unaffected side of the
body toward the aisle as this will facilitate mobility to the strong side of the body in the event of an evacuation.

NOTE: A person suffering from a stroke may not be able to perceive objects on the paralyzed side.

4.1.58 ORTHOTIC POSITIONING DEVICES
4. SAFETY BRIEFINGS & SPAT PROCEDURES
4.1 Safety Briefings & Spat Procedures
4.14, 4.14.1, 4.14.3

An orthotic positioning device (OPD) is a device or supportive brace designed to assist people, with weak or ineffective
joints or muscles, to position and support themselves in such a way that the aircraft safety belt can be used as an
effective and primary means of restraint.
Generally, an OPD is designed and used to help support and position a person who has:
1. Significant postural asymmetries of the pelvis, trunk, and/or hips that lack flexibility
2. Significant hyper or hypotonia, spasticity, or mixed athetoid dysfunctions
3. Absent or impaired sensation in an area of contact with a seating surface
4. Past history of, or current pressure ulcer, on an area of contact with a seating surface.

An OPD may also be used by a person who has difficulty controlling the movement of their body or has muscle spasms
that cause their body to extend involuntarily. Some examples of this would include Cerebral Palsy and spastic
quadriplegia.
Each OPD is specifically designed to meet the support needs of an individual and its use is similar to any other medically
required assistive or positioning device.
PROCEDURES FOR OCCUPYING A SEAT WITH AN OPD DEVICE
The person is seated in the OPD while they and the OPD occupy an a/c seat. In this way, the person is properly
positioned in order to use the existing a/c safety belt as their primary means of restraint while they are using the OPD for
support. While an OPD may be equipped with an internal harness to position a person in the device and provide that
person with additional security and support, the OPD must not attach to the a/c seat and simply provides support, not
the restraint that is provided by the a/c safety belt.
A person may use an OPD in any seat on the a/c, except in an exit row seat, provided that the use of the OPD
does not block any pax’s egress from the a/c.
This type of OPD is not intended to be identified, sold or used as a child restraint system.
Crew members are not required to know how to operate any internal restraints on the OPD. This is the
responsibility of the person who is using the OPD or his/her attendant, if applicable.
Crew members are responsible for ensuring that the a/c safety belt, the primary means of restraint, is used
properly

4.1.59 RESTRAINT SYSTEMS FOR DISABLED PERSONS & ASSISTIVE SEATING DEVIC
4. SAFETY BRIEFINGS & SPAT PROCEDURES
4.1 Safety Briefings & Spat Procedures
4.14, 4.14.1

Restraint systems for disabled persons sold in Canada will be affixed with the National Safety Mark (Ref 4.20.7),
indicating that the restraint system conforms to CMVSS 213.3 and in the US with FMVSS 213.
Medical appliances may be permitted provided the aircraft safety belt is used as the primary means of restraint and can
be properly adjusted and evenly tightened across the lap of the child or person.

4. SAFETY BRIEFINGS & SPAT PROCEDURES
4.1 Safety Briefings & Spat Procedures
11.2, 11.2.1, 11.2.2, 11.2.3

Communicable diseases are illnesses that spread from one person to another or from an animal to a person, or from a
surface or a food. Diseases can be transmitted during air travel through: direct contact with a sick person, respiratory
droplet spread from a sick person sneezing or coughing, contact with blood or other body fluids, breathing in viruses or
bacteria in the air, contact with a contaminated surface or object, bites from insects or animals that can transmit the
disease or ingestion of contaminated food or water.
Prior to departure it is important to monitor your passengers and be on the lookout for passengers who may be
exhibiting signs of illness. If you suspect a passenger may be ill or have a communicable disease (measles,
chicken pox, tuberculosis, etc.) investigate further.
1. Keep as safe a distance as possible or use a mask.
2. Tactfully discuss the situation with the pax (ask how are you feeling today?).
3. If the need arises consult with the Passenger Agent or PIC before taking any action.
4. The final decision regarding the carriage of restricted passengers rests with the PIC.

4.1.65 PAX WITH COMMUNICABLE DISEASES APPROVED FOR TRAVEL
4. SAFETY BRIEFINGS & SPAT PROCEDURES
4.1 Safety Briefings & Spat Procedures
11.2, 11.2.3

Pax with known communicable diseases can be carried with the written approval of the Company under the direction of
a medical doctor.
Pax who may be suspected of suffering from a communicable disease must obtain from the physician in charge of the
case or other proper medical authority, written assurance that all necessary precautionary measures have been taken
and that, by the use of a face mask provided by the medical facility, disinfectants by the pax / attendant during the flight,
no danger of spreading the disease to the other pax remain.
Authorization from a Medical Officer must be obtained to enable travel.
A communicable disease according to the World Health Organization is suspected when a traveler (pax or crewmember)
has a fever (temperature of 38 degrees C / 100 degrees F or greater) associated with one or more of the following signs
or symptoms:
Appearing obviously unwell
Persistent coughing
Impaired breathing
Persistent diarrhea
Persistent vomiting
Skin rash
Bruising or bleeding without previous injury
Confusion of recent onset.

The following procedures will apply with all known or suspected cases of communicable diseases:
The pax should be seated in the front row of the a/c or the last row, with no other pax seated in the row in front, aft or
across the aisle, but never at an emergency exit. (A 2 row radius in all directions is deemed best when able).
If a pax was identified inflight by a crewmember of possibly being contagious, they will be relocated as per above
and do not reuse the now vacated seat, the Captain must be advised.

Ask accompanying traveler(s) (spouse, children, friends) and any other pax seated in the same row if they are
having similar symptoms.

311 / 845

Ensure any COB follows the ill traveler to their new seat location; but only handle the COB while wearing proper
protective barriers.
Pax with the same illness should be seated together in the a/c and should be wearing a face mask.
A single patient should be seated in a window seat and the adjacent seat left vacant or occupied by a medical
attendant.
Any other pax located within less than 1 metre of the ill pax(s) should also be wearing a face mask.
It is preferable that only 1 F/A be designated to assist these pax and it is recommended that the F/A who was initially
in contact with the ill or suspected ill pax be the one to don protective barriers and continue to assist.
If more than one is assisting, all F/A’s must wear gloves and face masks and avoid hand-face contact at all times
while wearing, except when needing to replace the mask.
When replacing the gloves, remove and dispose of safely as per procedures to avoid cross contamination.
The F/A’s must wash hands frequently despite the glove barrier.
When the face masks becomes damp or humid they should be replaced and disposed of safely.
After touching a used mask, proper hand hygiene must be practiced immediately.
All soiled items (used tissues, face masks, oxygen mask and tubing, linen, pillows, blankets, seat pocket items,
gloves, etc.) shall be placed in a clear plastic bag and labeled BIOHAZARD.
If the ill passenger used the lavatory, all hard surfaces must be disinfected immediately following their use.
Advise the Captain to contact company and advise of the requirement for the a/c to receive a biohazard cleaning
upon arrival.

The Captain is also required by the International Civil Aviation Organization regulations (ICAO Annnex 9, Chapter 8,
and paragraph 8.15) and the World Health Organization International Health Regulations to report the suspected
case(s) to air traffic control.

Should any ill pax refuse to don a face mask and they are coughing, ask him / her to follow respiratory etiquette:
Provide tissues and then advise to use the tissues to cover the mouth and nose when speaking, sneezing or
coughing.
Advise the ill traveler(s) to practice proper hand hygiene.
If the hands become visibly soiled they must be immediately washed.
Provide an air sickness bag to be used for the safe disposal of the tissues.

2. Pull sharply on the top strip in a ripping
/ tearing motion to break the vacuum
seal.

339 / 845

3. Remove PBE from vacuum sealed
pouch and unfold far enough to reveal
oxygen cylinders.

4. Grasp each cylinder securely, one in
each hand, with thumbs pointing toward
the valves (the thin end of each bottle).

5. Sharply snap the cylinders away from
each other to activate the oxygen flow.

6. Hold the PBE at about waist level and
place both hands inside the neck seal
opening with palms facing each other
and open the neck seal as far as
possible.

7. Lift up the opened hood with both hands,
and then lower it down over the head
until it fits securely around the neck.

8. Ensure that the neck seal makes a
proper seal around the neck ensuring
that all hair is tucked inside the neck seal
and that clothing is not trapped inside the
seal.
9. Breathe normally.
10. If you wear glasses, it is recommended
that you don the hood by placing the
neck seal against the back of your head
and pulling the hood forward and down
over your head and glasses.
11. To avoid losing oxygen once the
system is activated, and to minimize
the amount of toxins that may enter
the hood, don the hood promptly after
activation.

340 / 845

WEARING THE PBE

1. Once fitted, the PBE will begin to inflate
due to the ingress of oxygen.
2. A hissing sound will be heard and the
service / end of service indicator will
commence flashing a green light;.
3. This green light indicates that the PBE is
operating correctly.
4. It will continue to flash during the full
operating cycle of 15 minutes.
5. If the green light fails to flash the PBE
should be removed immediately.
6. At the end of the operating cycle, the
service / end of service indicator will
begin to flash a red light, alternating
with the green, and the hood will start to
deflate.
7. This indicates that the oxygen supply is
depleted.
8. The wearer should leave the hazard area
and remove the hood.
9. Normal voice communication, telephone,
intercom, PA and megaphone can be
carried out while wearing the PBE.
10. As you wear the PBE it will get warm
inside and condensation will appear.

REMOVING THE PBE

1. When the red light flashes with the green
light, or when the hood collapses, move
immediately to a safe area and remove
the unit.
2. Insert the hands under the front of the
neck seal beneath the chin and pull
forward away from the face and upwards
over the head.

341 / 845

PRECAUTIONS

Before activating the oxygen, remove
objects from around the head (such as
hair combs, long earrings or jewelry) to
prevent them from puncturing the hood
or damaging the neck seal.
If the green light fails to flash upon
activation of the hood or the hood
collapses around the face remove the
hood immediately and obtain a new one.
Before removing the hood you must be
clear and away from any source of flame
as some residual oxygen may remain in
both the hood and your hair.
A pink humidity indicator means the
unit’s integrity has been affected and it
will have to be replaced with a
serviceable unit.

There is a smoke detector installed in the ceiling level of the lavatory. It has a self-test feature, audible warnings & visual
indicators. Maintenance performs the test on the unit, but F/A’s test the system via the F/A panel test switch light.
The smoke detector has an integral detector and alarm. A two-position lavatory detector switch light on the F/A panel’s,
illuminates either a red “LAV SMOKE” indicator when the detector is armed or an amber “DET OFF” indicator when it is
not armed. Absence of either annunciation on the switch light indicates that power from the DC ESSENTIAL and
CONTROL BUS is not available to that system.
When armed, smoke of a pre-determined density will trigger the smoke detector, sounding the alarm (a single ping) and
illuminating the two “LAV SMOKE” warning lights on the F/A panels. (One on the F/A panel breezeway location and one
on the PA call system panel).
The detector system may be tested by selecting the LAV SMOKE CB / button located on the F/A panels. F/A’s are to
verify serviceability by ensuring the CB / button illuminates RED when pressed.

AMOUNT ON BOARD

OPERATION

3 Passenger Oxygen Cylinders and 1 Large
Flight Attendant / First Aid Oxygen Cylinder.

1. Check the pressure gauge to ensure there
is sufficient quantity.

348 / 845

2. Advise PIC and ensure the “No Smoking”
sign is on and enforced.

3. Select high or low flow as situation
dictates.

4. Connect mask by aligning tabs on the
hose of the mask to the outlet adapter then
push in and twist to lock on.

5. Have pax wipe face free of grease and
make-up or F/A will complete.

6. Slowly turn the control valve counter
clockwise and test for oxygen flow either
by pinching mask closed and watching for
it to fill up, or if hose is equipped with a
flow indicator, watch for it to go from red to
green (ensure oxygen is odorless).

7. Contour mask around pax nose and mouth
and adjust the elastic band.

8. Instruct pax to breathe normally.

9. If infant, hold mask about 1 inch away from
the baby’s face. Do not place the mask
directly on a newborns face.

10. If pax has a breathing tube or a disk
through their throat, place the mask over
the opening in the throat.

11. Secure cylinder on the floor gauge up with
securing pouch to ensure it does not shift
during turbulence or landing should it still
be required.

12. Check the gauge regularly to ensure there

349 / 845

is still an adequate supply of oxygen.

13. Switch to another tank when pressure is
getting close to 200 PSI as some
oxygen must be reserved for F/A
decompression purposes.

14. Monitor the pax condition frequently and
update the PIC with any changes.

WHEN OXYGEN IS NO LONGER NEEDED

1. Remove the mask from the passenger
and slowly turn the oxygen valve to the
OFF position.
2. Disconnect mask.
3. Re-secure the cylinder back into its
designated location.
4. Advise the PIC that oxygen administration
is finished and what level the PSI is at.
5. Indicate use in the Cabin Log Book, secure
U/S tag and complete an SMS report.

PRECAUTIONS

Certain rules apply to using and carrying of
portable oxygen. Should certain precautions not
be taken, there is a risk of fire or explosion. In a
pure state, oxygen will combine with many
agents to support combustion. For these
reasons, always follow these rules when
handling oxygen equipment:
Never allow oxygen to contact oils, grease
or fat.
Keep all oxygen bottle components clean
of dirt and contamination.
Avoid heat generated by friction by

350 / 845

ensuring that initial opening and final
closure of valves is done slowly.
Do not place oxygen near any heat or
electrical sources.

minutes.

FEATURES OF THE PASSENGER
OXYGEN

Each unit has a continuous flow regulator, an
ON-OFF knob, and is automatic altitude
compensating.

(Continued)
When the outlet regulator is turned to the ON
position, it continuously provides oxygen to the
outlets at pressures dependent upon altitude.
For example: At sea level, you will receive a
flow rate of approximately 0.8 liters per minute
(LPM), and at 35,000 feet you will receive a
flow rate of approximately 3.6 liters per minute.
All consist of a carrying strap and an on / off
(altitude compensated) continuous flow dual
outlet regulator.

351 / 845

Each cylinder incorporates:
A low pressure relief valve to atmosphere
which protects the low pressure outlet side
from overpressure

A charging valve for recharging the
cylinder

A protective sealing cap is provided for the
valve

Two outlets with constant flow outlet
adaptors for connection of the two
constant flow masks

Two constant flow passenger masks in a
plastic dust proof bag are located at each
portable passenger cylinder

The masks must be attached to both outlet
adaptors at all times

These cylinders will normally be used
during post decompression.

FEATURES OF THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT /

The Main Passenger Door (MPD) is located at the rear of the cabin port side. It provides for Normal and Emergency
access / egress to and from the aircraft.
The MPD is comprised of two manually operated sections. A small upper section hinged at its upper edge that opens
outward and up, and a lower airstair portion hinged at its lower edge that opens outward and down.

Folding handrails, a recessed external handle grip, steps and an inflatable pressure seal are incorporated in the lower
section. A non-inflatable compression seal is attached to the upper section.
In the door closed position, the top edge of the lower section overlaps the bottom edge of the upper section. The lower
section therefore must be opened first. The upper section can only be operated from inside of the aircraft, while the lower
section can be operated from both inside and outside. Inflation and deflation of the door seal is automatic in operation,
charging and discharging of air pressure occurring simultaneously with door lock operation.

380 / 845

INTERIOR OPENING
1. In a single smooth motion lift the interior locking lever to the limit of its travel and push the stairs out. It will then open

under its own weight and the handrails will unfold.

2. Once the stairs have stopped moving, lock the airstairs into the down position by pushing on the handrail struts until

they are rigid.

381 / 845

3. Rotate upper door handle in the direction of the arrow and push the upper door outward and up.

INTERIOR CLOSING
1. Pull upper door partially in by means of the assist handle ensuring that the locking pins do not strike the door frame.
2. Pull the upper door locking lever inboard.
3. Pull upper door to the fully closed position and rotate locking lever down to the locked position.
4. In a single smooth motion, lift airstair handrails and pull airstairs up and in.
5. Push interior locking lever down to the fully locked position with your hand, DO NOT USE YOUR FOOT.

NOTE: Keep this simple rule in mind:
To OPEN: You start bottom to top. To CLOSE: You start top to bottom.
EXTERIOR OPENING

382 / 845

1. Pull the recessed exterior locking lever sharply down to the limit of its travel. This will unlock the door and displace it
outward. The door will not fall open.

2. Using your hand grasp the door hand hold in the door and lower the door to the ground.
3. Lock airstairs into the down position by pushing on the handrails until the struts are rigid.

EXTERIOR CLOSING

1. Lift handrail to unlock struts.
2. Push door up to the closed position.
3. Return exterior locking lever to the fully stowed position.

383 / 845

EMERGENCY OPERATION OF THE MPD

The emergency operation of the MPD is almost exactly the same as normal door operation with exception of one thing.
As time is of the essence in an emergency evacuation you do not need to worry about pushing on the stairs to ensure the
handrail struts are rigid. The momentum of the passengers evacuating will lock the stairs into the down position.

6.1, 6.1.1, 6.1.1 (a), 6.1.1 (b), 6.2, 6.2.3, 6.2.4, 6.4, 6.4.3

An Emergency Door Exit is located at the rear of the cabin on the starboard side directly across from the MPD on all
aircraft.
The Rear Emergency Door Exit may be removed from inside or outside of the aircraft.
The door is secured by four latches on its forward and aft edges which are operated simultaneously through an internal
mechanism by an internal and external handle. The mechanism also displaces the door from its frame in an outboard
direction upon removal.
An inflatable seal around the periphery of the door provides air tightness when the cabin is pressurized. The seal is
inflated automatically upon door handle closure, and is deflated automatically when the door is jettisoned or removed.
Spring-loading of the Rear Emergency Door handle and the installation of a guard around its lower portion avert the
possibility of accidental door seal deflation.
The Rear Emergency Door is removed by rotating the internal or external handle in an upward direction (a release button
on the external handle must be depressed to expose the handle).
Initial handle movement releases the door seal pressure and subsequent movement displaces the door outward.
From inside the door is separated from the aircraft by simultaneously lifting and pushing outward on both the operating
handle and the handgrip on the aft end of the door.
From the outside the door is separated by lifting and pulling outward on the bottom of the door.

Three escape windows are located on the combi / cargo a/c. There are two at row 9 on either side of the a/c and 1 in the
forward cabin on the right directly across from the Cargo Door.
These are plug type windows, and when installed, are held in place by mechanical locks and the a/c cabin pressure.
The Emergency Window Exits may be removed from inside or outside of the aircraft. They are secured by an upper and
lower locking pin, the former of which is actuated by an internal handle and the latter by an external handle. Each handle
also operates a vent in the window which opens to depressurize the cabin before disengaging the locking pin.
The exit is opened from the inside by pulling inward and down on the RED handle above the window and draw the top of
the Exit inward. The exit is then lifted from its lower locking pin using the lower handhold.
They are opened from the outside by pressing the handle release button below the window, turning the handle in a
downward direction to withdraw the locking pin and then pushing the exit inward. The exit then falls away from its upper
locking pin.

5.1.41 GAINING ENTRY INTO THE FLIGHT DECK
5. SAFETY & EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT
5.1 Safety & Emergency Equipment
4.7, 4.7.2

During normal flight operations the a/c interphone will be used for all communications between the cabin and the F/D.
Prior to gaining entry into the F/D communications must have been first established via the interphone with the F/D crew.
In the event the a/c interphone becomes U/S the predetermined distinctive knock can be used to gain entry into the F/D.
Prior to the first flight of the day during the pre-flight briefing, a distinctive signal familiar to all crewmembers will be
determined in order to gain entry into the F/D during flight.
This signal may be in the form of a distinguished knock or a verbal code word. The level of wind noise experienced in the
F/D should be a prime consideration when determining a signal. Crew members are reminded that any form of a
communication signal must be loud and definitive.
Air Crew members are reminded that if long periods occur between communications with the Cabin Crew they should try
to establish communications.

5.1 Safety & Emergency Equipment
6.14, 6.14.1, 6.14.2

Clearly marked exit lights are located at strategic points throughout the a/c to mark the approved emergency exit routes.
Some of these lights are fixed, and there is one portable light located in the F/D that may be removed from its stowed
position and used as a flashlight.
There are also exterior emergency lights to illuminate the escape paths in darkened egress environments. The
emergency lights are installed independently of the a/c electrical system.
The system is controlled by a switch in the F/D on the pax warning panel having three positions OFF- ARMED-ON. With
the switch in the ARMED position the emergency lights will normally be off but will illuminate automatically if a/c electrical
power is lost or turned off or with sufficient “G” force.
These lights may also be turned on by a switch on the F/A panel.
On the DHC-7, this switch has NORMAL-ON positions marked EMERG LTS and is guarded to the NORMAL position.
(Reference Chapter 12 for DHC-8 Emergency Light Switch on FA Panel)

6.1.5 CONSIDERATIONS FOR A MEDICAL EMERGENCY
6. COMPANY SPECIFIC FIRST AID PROCEDURES
6.1 Company Specific First Aid Procedures
11.3, 11.3.1

In-flight medical emergencies can be broadly divided into two categories – injury or health related situations. Injuries can
occur as a result of a turbulence encounter, luggage falling from an overhead bin or being improperly lifted/carried, an
onboard altercation or even cuts from a/c equipment or furnishings or a multitude of other scenarios.
Health issues for a single passenger can range from fainting or shortness of breath to allergic reaction to missed
medication to gastrointestinal issues, to stroke, heart attack or even death. In very rare cases, food poisoning or a
communicable disease may affect a number of passengers at the same time.
Cabin crew may become aware of a passenger in medical distress by direct observation, or the situation is brought to
your attention by the individual, a travelling companion or another nearby passenger.
This chapter provides general guidance and information pertaining to protecting your own personal safety and the
handling of illness or injury to passengers when crewed onboard or post evacuation. Reference the FARG for all
additional first aid information.

6.1.22 FACTORS THAT WILL AFFECT YOUR TUC
6. COMPANY SPECIFIC FIRST AID PROCEDURES
6.1 Company Specific First Aid Procedures

Altitude of the a/c at time of decompression. The higher the altitude, the less your TUC will be.
Rate of Ascent/climb: The faster the rate, the less your TUC will be.
Physical activity at the time of oxygen reduction, for example someone who is up and walking around (such as
F/A’s) are reducing their TUC by 50%.
Day to Day Factors & Health:
Age: Infants and the elderly are susceptible to hypoxia at altitudes as low as 3000 feet.
Physical condition and illness: (cardiac / respiratory) will affect your TUC, especially when the body is
already working harder to fight infections or to provide the tissues with necessary requirements.
Obese pax: TUC is reduced because nitrogen is stored in fat cells.

6. COMPANY SPECIFIC FIRST AID PROCEDURES
6.1 Company Specific First Aid Procedures
11.6, 11.6.4, 11.6.5

The confines of an aircraft cabin may not be the ideal place to render first aid, but when the need arises, it will have to
suffice. Minor cuts can be addressed easily. Oxygen can be provided at the pax seated location. The greatest challenge
would be when you have to provide CPR. It requires floor space for not only the passenger but for the FA to provide the
medical assistance. The only area’s ideally available to provide the needed space would be;
DHC-7 at the front of the a/c if in a combi config. directly in front of the bulkhead or at the rear of the a/c adjacent to the
rear starboard door exit.
DHC-8 at the front of the a/c between the front row of seats and the galley/MPD
Keep in mind, the pax and the FA will have to be secured back into their seats again for landing and or turbulence. The
pax cannot be secured to a seat in an emergency exit row or where they could obstruct access to an emergency exit or
safety equipment.

442 / 845

6.1.25 OTHER IMPROVISED FIRST AID EQUIPMENT
6. COMPANY SPECIFIC FIRST AID PROCEDURES
6.1 Company Specific First Aid Procedures

In addition to the First Aid Kit and O2 being used in the event of an illness or injury, the following improvised items may
also prove beneficial in dealing with a medical incident:
BLANKETS // PILLOWS // PAPER TOWELS - For absorption of blood, as padding for a splint, as a neck roll and for
warmth
MAGAZINES // NEWS PAPERS - For stabilizing an arm splint
HERC STRAPS - For securing legs together
BROOM - For stabilizing a leg splint;
SEATBELT EXTENSION - For an arm sling
GARBAGE BAGS - Slings & securing splints.

6.1.26 EFFECTS OF ALTITUDE
6. COMPANY SPECIFIC FIRST AID PROCEDURES
6.1 Company Specific First Aid Procedures
11.6, 11.6.1

Altitude sickness (mountain sickness) is associated with mountain climbing and with being in high-elevation locations
such as Mt. Everest or the mountains of Peru. Altitude sickness can vary in severity. The mildest form of altitude sickness
(acute mountain sickness) can occur from flying.
Altitude sickness (mountain sickness) occurs if you increase your elevation quickly without having time to adjust to the
lowered oxygen and air pressure found at high altitude. High altitudes begins at around 8,000 feet.
Many airplanes can fly at very high altitudes of up to 30,000 to 45,000 feet. The DHC7’s max altitude is just over 20,000
feet. The cabin air pressure in an airplane is adjusted to compensate for those high altitudes. The oxygen level is
comparable to levels found in elevations of 5,000 to 9,000 feet. On the DHC7 the cabin altitude is usually maintained at
approx. 8000 feet.
Both men and women can get altitude sickness. Age, general health, and physical condition do not affect your chances
for altitude sickness. However, not everyone who flies gets this condition.
Altitude sickness symptoms vary based upon the type of altitude sickness that you have. Symptoms may begin after three
to nine hours of flying at high elevations.
You may be more likely to get altitude sickness on flights if you’re dehydrated. Drinking alcohol or caffeinated beverages
before and during your flight can also increase your chances of experiencing symptoms.
At high altitudes, oxygen molecules are further apart because there is less pressure to “push” them together. This
effectively means there are fewer oxygen molecules in the same volume of air as we inhale. This is often referred to as
“hypoxia”. Hypoxia is usually associated with acute mountain sickness.
Hypoxia by definition, is the lack of sufficient oxygen in the blood, tissues, and/or cells to maintain normal
physiological function.
The mildest form of hypoxia symptoms will be:
Shortness of breath
Headache
Lightheadedness
Loss of appetite
Trouble sleeping or sleepiness
Dizziness
Nausea

Today’s aviation industry is a 24/7 operation that produces a variety of challenges for cabin crew members including
extended duty periods, highly variable schedules, frequent time zone changes when travelling internationally and
increased pax loads. While these operational requirements may be necessary, they are far from ideal with respect to the
human body’s biological rhythms for managing sleep and alertness. In fact, acute sleep loss, sustained periods of
wakefulness, and circadian factors resulting from this form of misalignment all contribute to fatigue and fatigue related
mishaps.
Most commonly, fatigue is described as sleepiness or a general tired feeling resulting from extended wakefulness,
insufficient sleep, or circadian disruption. Although this definition sufficiently describes fatigue in a general way, it
inadequately represents the performance factors associated with fatigue.
In the aviation industry, it may be better to consider fatigue in terms of symptoms such as: forgetfulness; poor decisionmaking; slowed reaction time; reduced vigilance; poor communication; impaired mood; nodding off; or becoming fixated,
apathetic, or lethargic. It is important to recognize that fatigue is more than sleepiness or tiredness.
Fatigue has psychological, physiological, and emotional implications that can impact the performance of safety-related
duties, particularly during non-routine and emergency events.
Fatigue is a major human factors hazard because it affects most aspects of a crewmember’s ability to do their job.
Fatigue, therefore, has important implications for safety.
Transient Fatigue is short-term tiredness caused by extended wakefulness. It can usually be addressed by increasing or
improving sleep.
Cumulative Fatigue with repeated periods of extended wakefulness or reduced sleep opportunities, cumulative fatigue
can occur. Symptoms can include both physical and psychological issues.
Adequate sleep is a necessity and sleep deprivation may lead to serious health disorders. It is essential that
crewmembers be well rested, both at home and while on a layover, before working any flight. Sleep deprivation is defined
as a lack of sleep. The need for sleep varies for each individual. While some people need more sleep than others, 90% of
people sleep between six and nine hours in each 24 – hour period. However, it should be noted that each individual has
his/her own sleeping pattern.
Sleeping patterns may change according to health and age
Identifying and respecting your sleep pattern is a condition for good performance

If the amount of sleep had not been sufficient, particularly over a few days, the individual will build up a “sleep deficit” that
will need to be recovered, otherwise it will affect their level of performance. Crewmember’s sleeping patterns will often be
disrupted due to flying duties.
Short-haul flying will often require multiple sectors working very early in the morning or late into the night. Long-haul
flights have the added consequence of crossing multiple time zones, which means that rest is taken at a time the body is
not used to.

Symptoms and Effects of Fatigue Symptoms may not be noticed when stimuli such as noise, physical activity, caffeine,
nicotine, thirst, hunger, excitement or other distractions are present. However, once the stimuli are gone, fatigue
symptoms such as the following can be observed:
Eyes going in and out of focus
Persistent yawning
Wandering or poorly organized thoughts
Reduced short-term memory
Worsened mood (i.e., irritability)
Lack of concentration
Lack of situational awareness Symptoms such as those listed above can have severe consequences on an
individual’s performance, including:
Slower reaction time
Reduced motor skills and coordination
Impaired judgment
Poor decision making
Reduced flexibility
Reduced situation awareness
Decreased work efficiency
Degraded crew coordination
Reduced motivation
Decreased vigilance
Increased variability of work performance.

Fatigue Preventative Strategies
If is of utmost importance to execute flight operations as alertly as possible. Negative occurrences, such as sleep
disturbance and/or circadian disruptions, may be successfully counteracted if proper preventive measures are taken. The
following recommendations are general and have to be adapted to one’s own needs:

447 / 845

Restful sleep requirements (“good sleep habits”)
Protect your individually required sleep time
Keep a regular sleep/wake schedule (when possible)
Use a suitable environment (i.e., shades, lower temperature, earplugs)
Develop and practice a regular pre-sleep
Eat a light snack, if hungry, and avoid eating immediately before bedtime
No alcohol before bedtime (alcohol induces sleep, but has a negative effect on sleep quality
No coffee, black tea or other sources of caffeine before bedtime
No exercise before bedtime
On short layovers, try to stay aligned to home base time
Avoid use of TV, mobile phone or tablet devices while in bed
If you do not fall asleep within 30 minutes, get out of bed for a time (do not toss and turn).

Personal Mitigation Strategies Every flight duty must be performed in good physical and mental condition. Crew should be
well-rested as a result of appropriate personal conduct with regard to sleep, nutrition and consideration of the effects of
medications, alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, etc.
The following are strategies that can be used to ensure one is adequately prepared for flight duty:
Daily
Get as much sleep as possible prior to the trip
Try to take an afternoon nap, in a bed in a darkened room, before operating a night flight
Practice active ways to relax after work
Do regular physical activity during a short layover (less than 3 days)
Try to sleep as much within 24 hours (in one or more sleep periods) as in a normal 24-hour period at home
If the circumstances permit, sleep if you are sleepy
Try to maintain the sleep/wake rhythm of your original time zone.

448 / 845

Inflight
Give preference to light food and high-protein meals
Avoid high-fat and high-carbohydrate food
Drink plenty of fluids, preferably water
Caffeine can help counteract noticeable fatigue symptoms, if used strategically.

6.29.1, 6.29.1 (a), 10.2, 10.2.7, 10.2.7 (a), 10.2.7 (b), 10.2.7 (c)

The air conditioning system provides conditioned air for heating, cooling, ventilation and pressurization of the flight deck
compartment, passenger / cargo cabin and rear baggage compartment.
Bleed air discharged from each of the four engines supplies the system.
Bleed air leaving the engines is sufficient to heat the a/c interior under the coldest ambient conditions. On hot days bleed
air is cycled through the refrigeration packs (which are driven by the air’s velocity) where it is cooled to the required
temperature.
Conditioned air enters the cabin from the distribution ducts through low velocity grilles in the cabin walls below the
overhead stowage bins and is exhausted through continuous slots along each edge of the cabin floor. The exhaust air
spills into the under floor area from which it is induced overboard by the pressurization system outflow valve.
On the ground, conditioned air may be obtained from a ground source utilizing the fuselage receptacle.
Passenger cabin and flight deck temperatures are controlled separately and may be used manually or in the automatic
mode.
Dual adjustable fresh air vents (gaspers) are provided in the pax cabin. They are on all DHC7’s except for UAT &
PBJ. The fresh air vents are located adjacent to the reading lights in the overhead PSU. They are manually controlled by
rotating the bezel counterclockwise to open and clockwise to close. One is also provided in the lavatory compartment.

7.1 Aircraft Specific
6.29, 6.29.1, 6.29.1 (a), 10.7, 10.7.2, 10.9, 10.9.1

Applicable to CEV’s motorized flushing toilet only, waste water is drained directly overboard through a venture located on
the underside of the fuselage. This provides for the discharge of GRAY WATER from the a/c waste water system. As this
discharges when at a specified volume, an effort should be made to not utilize the lavatory while the aircraft is on the
ground being serviced.
Drain lines from the floor drain, as well as those from the airstair and rear emergency exit threshold drains are connected
to a common drain pipe.
This pipe which connects to the venture is a 7 degree slope to allow drainage when the aircraft is on the ground.
During flight, the differential pressure between the cabin air and the outside air induces drainage.
NOTE: Hazards to be aware of are biohazard contamination threats that can cause damage to the underbelly and
contents and also should there ever be a large leak of the waste system, over time the rudder lines can become
thin and fragile like spaghetti.

8.1.2 DEFINITION OF DANGEROUS GOODS
8. DANGEROUS GOODS // WHMIS // ICING
8.1 Dangerous Goods // WHMIS // Icing

Dangerous Goods definition (from the Act) means a product, substance or organism included by its nature or by the
regulations in any of the classes listed in the schedule to the Act. (Reference 8.3.0 entitled Definition of 9 classes of
Dangerous Goods)
Dangerous Goods are capable of posing significant risk to health, safety or property when transported by air.
Dangerous Goods must be identified, classified, packaged, accepted, marked, labelled and documented in accordance
with the current edition of the International Civil Aviation Organization Technical Instructions (ICAO TI’s)
Some Dangerous Goods are too dangerous to be carried by aircraft, others may be carried on Cargo Aircraft Only, and
some are acceptable on both Cargo and Passenger Aircraft. A number of limitations are placed on Dangerous Goods
which are permitted to be transported by air. These limitations are established by these Regulations.

Dangerous Good are divided into three categories:
1. ACCEPTABLE: for transport by air, provided all the provisions of the Regulations are complied with;
2. FORBIDDEN: for transport on a passenger aircraft or by air; and
3. EXCEPTED: from the provisions of the Regulations.

518 / 845

8.1.14 AIRCRAFT CRITICAL SURFACE CONTAMINATION
8. DANGEROUS GOODS // WHMIS // ICING
8.1 Dangerous Goods // WHMIS // Icing

Aircraft surface contamination is a natural hazard of flying at any time of year and particularly during winter. It is a build
up or accumulation of snow, ice, frost, or slush on any of the aircraft’s critical surfaces. The critical surfaces are the
wings, control surfaces, horizontal and vertical stabilizers, propellers, engine intakes and any other stabilizing surface of
the a/c.
The presence of snow, frost, ice or slush particularly on the wings of an aircraft significantly alters airflow characteristics
over the wing, reducing lift, increasing drag and the likelihood that the aircraft will stall during take-off.
The weight of accumulated ice or snow on all surfaces of the a/c also adds to its total weight posing a secondary risk to
safe flight operations. For these reasons, frost, snow, ice and slush must always be removed from an aircraft before
take-off.
F/A’s must be aware of the potential hazards of critical surface contamination at all times. Should a pax raise a concern
or the F/A’s notice a buildup of snow, ice, frost or slush on the wings or other critical surfaces of the a/c prior to take-off,
the ICFA will immediately advise the PIC.
Upon receipt of such a report, the PIC or designate must conduct an inspection.The inspection shall be carried out by:
The PIC
A crew member designated by the PIC
A person other than a crew member who is delegated by the operator and has received training concerning Surface
Contamination that is required by the Canadian Aviation Regulations and Standards.

If the a/c is deemed to be contaminated, arrangements will be made to facilitate the removal of the contamination prior to
take-off. The methods for removing of frozen contaminant include:
The application of heat; ie: warm hangar, solar heat (the sun), or the use of a heater
The application of a de-icing / anti-icing fluid (We use a cherry picker style truck)
Brushing.

519 / 845

8.1.15 DE-ICING // ANTI-ICING
8. DANGEROUS GOODS // WHMIS // ICING
8.1 Dangerous Goods // WHMIS // Icing

Is a two step procedure to remove contamination from the aircrafts critical surfaces, followed by the application of a
thickened anti-icing fluid to prevent further accumulations for a limited time.
If a clean aircraft for departure cannot be assured, the only acceptable alternative is to cancel or postpone the flight until
conditions are acceptable. In all cases the PIC will have the total responsibility in deciding whether or not a flight will
operate in condtions of icing.
F/D crew, cabin crew and ground crew all have responsibilities that coordinate to allow the a/c to remain free of
contaminants, thereby maintaining the “Clean Aircraft Concept”.
The “Clean Aircraft Concept” is when material or fluids, including frost, ice and snow are “NOT ADHERING” to the
critical surfaces of the aircraft.

520 / 845

8.1.16 IF THE A/C IS GOING TO BE DE-ICED / ANTI-ICED
8. DANGEROUS GOODS // WHMIS // ICING
8.1 Dangerous Goods // WHMIS // Icing

The PIC must brief the ICFA / F/A’s in the pre-flight briefing.
Pax must be informed prior to de-icing or anti-icing taking place.

521 / 845

8.1.17 F/A COMMUNICATION RESPONSIBILITY RE: SURFACE CONTAMINATION
8. DANGEROUS GOODS // WHMIS // ICING
8.1 Dangerous Goods // WHMIS // Icing

F/A’s are required to monitor wing surface conditions for contamination in conditions of adverse weather and advise
the PIC “Prior To The Take-Off Roll”.
F/A’s are required to report to the PIC, any time “Prior To The Take-Off Roll” any concerns conveyed to them by a
passenger relating to wing contamination.

NOTE: Due to our “high wing” monoplane it is difficult for a F/A to see the top surface of the wings. The best
time for getting a good visual of the wings would be during your PFSC when walking towards the aircraft.
However, with that being said, if you have any concerns during inclement weather conditions SPEAK UP about it.
The DHC-7 and DHC-8 are equipped with de-icing boots located on the leading edge of the wings, the horizontal
stabilizer and the engine inlets.

522 / 845

8.1.18 GLOBALLY HARMONIZED SYSTEM
8. DANGEROUS GOODS // WHMIS // ICING
8.1 Dangerous Goods // WHMIS // Icing

In 2015 Canada adopted the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) in WHMIS
with those of other countries. The goal is that the same set of rules for classifying hazards, and the same format and
content for labels and safety data sheets (SDS) will be adopted and used around the world.

The purpose of GHS is to PROTECT YOUR HEALTH AND SAFETY by giving YOU information that YOU need in order
to identify or recognize the potential hazards of the materials to which you are exposed, or are likely to be exposed to on
your job.
As such SDS (Safety Data Sheets) are located in the flight deck of each aircraft on an IPAD and in our workplace it is
available online via MSDSonline.com
Prior to working with any product containing hazardous contents you must first have received WHMIS training. Next,
check for a label, read and understand the appropriate SDS and ensure you ARE wearing the required PPE as directed
to do so by the SDS. Know where all of your safety equipment is located in your work area and follow all safety
procedures associated with the SDS instructions. Ensure your immediate coworkers do the exact same.

9.1.17 RESTRICTED AREA IDENTITY CARD // RAIC PASS
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

Persons required to work within the restricted area of an airport require a RAIC PASS. This pass is an important part of
the front line security at Canadian airports. A pass that comes into the possession of an unauthorized person is a serious
breach of security that could have grave consequences.
Crew members are required to be alert to possible breaches of security. It is your responsibility to challenge any person
on the ramp / apron area that is not wearing a RAIC Pass or company issued ID.
If the person has a legitimate reason for being airside, notify the PIC or Airport Manager and make arrangements to have
a temporary pass issued. If the person has no reason to be airside, escort him / her to a non-restricted area and notify the
PIC or Airport Manager;
NOTE: All temporary pass holders must be under the supervision of a permanent pass holder.
When you signed for and were issued your RAIC PASS you certified that you had read, understood and agreed to
abide by the Terms of Issue.
The pass issued to you is on loan to you and is the property of the issuing airport authority.
All crew members shall wear the RAIC PASS above the waist and have the picture side showing at all times
when working in any restricted area of the airport. It has been designed to be worn on outer clothing.
No person shall enter or remain in a restricted area unless the pass is clearly displayed on the person’s clothing.
Crew members displaying a RAIC PASS will normally be allowed access to restricted areas without the need of
clearing through a security check point, however if and when requested to go through a screening, you must willingly
do so and present your RAIC to the screening officer.
When operating on board the a/c, your pass is not to be visible to the pax’s.
Never assist anyone without a valid pass to enter a restricted area.
You are to safeguard your pass at all times and report the loss or theft of your pass immediately to the Pass Control
Office or to the person who issued the pass.
When an employee reports the loss or theft of a RAIC PASS, the company must immediately report the loss or theft
to the aerodrome operator.
You are not permitted to loan your pass to another person.
Your pass permits you to gain access to a restricted area in relation to the performance of your job.
You are not permitted to use your pass to be in a restricted area that is not required for you to perform your job
duties.

542 / 845

You are to surrender your pass upon resigning or termination of employment (directly to the Flight Attendant
Manager who is responsible to ensure it is given to the proper authority). You may also be required to surrender your
RAIC to the “Minister / Transport Canada Inspector, the operator of the Aerodrome, a Screening Officer, or a Peace
Officer.
To ensure that RAIC regulations are adhered to there are penalties for failing to abide these regulations. Penalties
are authorized under the Aeronautics Act and can be as high as $5000.00 for an individual and $25,000.00 for the
Company.

543 / 845

9.1.18 COMPANY ISSUED KEY OR KEY CODE
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

Every crew member who has a company issued key or who has been provided with a company issued key code shall not:
Loan or give a key or a code issued to him / her to another person
Be in possession of a key that was not properly issued to him / her
Leave your keys unattended
Permit unauthorized duplication of company issued keys.

544 / 845

9.1.19 SECURITY OF PERSONAL BELONGINGS // CREW BAGGAGE
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

To prevent loss of personal property, crew members should stow valuable belongings such as purse, wallet, ID,
travel or company documents etc. in areas that are not easily accessible by passengers or areas of the a/c that are
under constant supervision by a crew member.
As a crew member it is very important to safeguard your luggage. Your luggage could very well serve as a mode of
transportation for explosive devices, weapons or drugs.
Never leave your crew baggage unattended anywhere in the airport terminal building, in a hotel lobby or vehicle;
In some destinations, hotels may designate a separate vehicle to carry crew baggage. If this is the case, one
member of the crew should be designated to travel with the baggage to ensure that no one has unauthorized access
to it.
If you suspect that any of your belongings has been tampered with at any time, call the airport security, local police
or RCMP.

545 / 845

9.1.20 SECURITY OF COMPANY UNIFORMS
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

Never wear your uniform for longer than necessary.
Never wear your uniform into a liquor establishment / bar.
Do not lend uniform items or components to your friends.
Report the loss of your uniform or other items of company property to the Flight Attendant Manager.
When disposing of uniform components, always remove and safeguard any company insignia, name bars, wings,
strips, logo buttons or other identifying features.

546 / 845

9.1.21 SECURITY OF COMPANY MANUALS
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

Section 4.79 of the Aeronautics Act demands that the contents of any measure or order is not disclosed to any
unauthorized persons. Manuals contain such information and must be safeguarded. No one except the individual to
whom a company manual was issued should have access to that publication.
Always destroy pages removed from your manual when amendments are issued.
Always maintain your manual with all amendments correctly inserted to ensure consistency of information amongst
an entire crew.
Manuals should not be carried in your hand in case you put it down somewhere, or carried on the outside of Pullman
type suitcases.
Ensure that manuals are contained within crew bags at all times (on check ride days or when a/c copy is missing)
and that the bag is closed to prevent illicit access to it or your belongings.

547 / 845

9.1.22 SECURITY OF TRAVEL DOCUMENTS

9.1.23 INTERFERENCE WITH A CREW MEMBER // GENERAL
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

Air Tindi’s policies with regards to interference with a crew member are outlined in this section. Please note it is the
responsibility of all flight crew, cabin crew, ground services personnel and supervisors to ensure that these policies are
not compromised by the action of one or more obnoxious or inconsiderate pax.

549 / 845

9.1.24 PREVENTING AND MANAGING INCIDENTS OF INTERFERENCE WITH A CREW ME
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

Early detection of any inappropriate behavior is critical in the prevention of an occurrence that may pose a threat to the
safety of the flight and / or any person o/b.
Clearly identifying and dealing with potential troublesome passengers prior to boarding is the ideal situation. Although
this is not always possible since many don’t act up until later in the flight, all staff should be alert when dealing with
boarding passengers. Intervention is much easier on the ground.

550 / 845

9.1.25 CRITERIA USED TO DETERMINE THE ACCEPTANCE OR REFUSAL TO TRANSPOR
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

All staff whether ground agents, air crew, crew members, gate agents, ramp agents and their supervisors are vital in
identifying and dealing with problem passengers prior to or while boarding the aircraft.

551 / 845

9.1.26 PICKING PROBLEM PASSENGERS OUT OF THE CROWD
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

You can be fairly sure that if a pax is unruly, threatening or disorderly to ground staff or other pax at check-in or in the
lounge, they are likely going to be a problem for the crew members once o/b. This is the point where intervention is
most effective.
Obvious warning signs:
Drunkenness
Unusually loud and boisterous
Threatening, violent or disruptive
Smoking in no-smoking lounges.

When any of these types of behavior are observed, ground staff should notify a supervisor immediately so that positive
preventative action can be taken.
Some preventative intervention measures that could be taken by ground staff include:
Warn pax about their behavior; (should be done by a supervisor / manager).
Deny boarding and travel
Police intervention, when required
Always inform the PIC of the a/c and the crew members of any potential problem pax.

Should a situation develop/occur while the aircraft is in-flight our objective is primarily to apply methods to prevent
the situation from escalating. The ICFA shall notify the PIC of the potential risk and threat immediately.
Ask yourself these questions:
What’s the cause of the problem?
Is there some way of removing the cause or moving the pax?

Crews should be aware of the “what if’s” of the situation with regards to the safety of the other pax and crew members.
At times, clear concise direction to the individual will suffice, while at other times showing calm restraint and composure
may be the best method to de-escalate a volatile situation. The safety of the a/c, pax and crew are of primary importance.
Most incidents of unruly behavior are of relatively short duration and can usually be handled with verbal intervention by
the crew.

552 / 845

What about the situations that are prolonged or become violent? What protection does the law provide crew members
or other pax if physical intervention is necessary?
Physical intervention in the confines of an airborne a/c is obviously a last resort. Experience indicates however that it
does occasionally happen.

553 / 845

9.1.27 PROTECTION THE LAW PROVIDES FOR ALL PERSONS
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

Reasonable Force may lawfully be used to stop a criminal offence that is being committed or to prevent an offence
from being committed. (Sections 25 & 27, Criminal Code).
Everyone who is authorized by law to use force is criminally responsible for any excess thereof according to the
nature and quality of the act that constitutes the excess. Simply put, if you over-react to the threat, you may be held
criminally responsible (Section 26, Criminal Code).
(Section 27.1(1) of the Criminal Code) authorizes “every person” on board an a/c inflight to use reasonable force to
prevent the commission of an offence in the Criminal Code or any other Act of Parliament.
A crew member may arrest / restrain (and use reasonable force if necessary) a person who is caught committing a
criminal offence on or in relation to property that one has been authorized to be in lawful possession of. Simply put, if
you are an authorized employee of Air Tindi, you can arrest a person you observe committing a criminal offence on
or in relation to Air Tindi property. A criminal offence is any offence found in the Criminal Code of Canada (Section
494, Criminal Code).
Under section 2 of the Criminal Code of Canada, and further defined in Section 7(8) of the Criminal Code; a Pilot In
Command of an a/c registered in Canada under regulations made under the Aeronautics Act is: a Peace Officer
once the a/c is inflight. Once the external doors to the a/c are closed it is deemed to be “inflight”.
Any person(s) assisting (i.e., pax) may also use reasonable force to arrest or to prevent a breach of the peace.
(Sections 27 & 30, Criminal Code). Section 30 provides authority to everyone who witnesses the breach to interfere,
with the intent to prevent a continuance or a renewal of the breach.
Anyone may use as much force as is reasonably necessary to protect themselves or others under their protection
from assault. (Section 34, Criminal Code).

554 / 845

9.1.28 METHODS OF RESTRAINING PASSENGERS AND SAFETY OF RESTRAINED PASSE
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

In the event that a passenger needs to be restrained, ideally five to six able-bodied passengers (ABP’s) should be
involved.
Instruct two persons to hold each foot, two persons to hold each hand and one to apply the control device to the
hands and another to apply the control device to the feet.
Care must be exercised to ensure that the control device is applied correctly. Too loose and they are ineffective,
too tight and they can injuriously limit circulation.
The passenger’s hands should be secured behind his / her body. Check the thumbs for cyanosis to ensure the
circulation has not been infringed upon.
At no time will the passenger be restrained to any part of the a/c.
An ABP will need to be briefed and assigned to a restrained pax to assist in the event of an Emergency Evacuation
and to quickly release them from their restraining device using the angle cutters located in the restraint kit.
Preferably brief with them in an area where the restrained pax cannot overhear.
Emphasize the importance of keeping the angle cutters out of reach of the restrained pax and show them the quick
release procedure. Cut through both tie wraps at the center. Tell them when to cut the restraint, if they hear brace,
brace or 4 chimes.
It is unadvisable to leave the cabin unattended.

555 / 845

9.1.29 METHODS OF MAINTAINING PERSONAL SECURITY
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

Whenever a pax appears violent, mentally unstable or threatening, methods of maintaining personal security during an
incident include the following:
Remain Calm and respectful
Remove possible weapons from area (knives, bottles, any sharp object)
Solicit assistance from suitable voluntary pax
Keep the individual under watch at all times
Stance – Do not get down to eye level
Maintain safe distance
Instinctive blocking, team approach with ABP’s (distraction) are all methods that may be used to maintain personal
security during an incident.
Onboard equipment can be used for defensive purposes. Coats, bags, seat cushions and other bulky items may be
used defensively during an attack to distract, defend against an aggressive passenger.
The ICFA shall attempt to calm the pax and resolve the problem on an individual basis.

556 / 845

9.1.30 THE 4 LEVELS OF INTEFERENCE WITH A CREW MEMBER
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

In order to relay information to the PIC in a timely and efficient manner, four levels of interference have been established.

557 / 845

9.1.31 LEVEL 1 // MINOR NATURE
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

DESCRIPTION

Is an incident that either requires no action of the
crew member beyond heightened awareness or
is effectively and quickly resolved by a crew
member and which includes but is not limited to:
The use of unacceptable language towards a
crew member
Unacceptable behavior towards a crew
member
A display of suspicious behavior.

PROCEDURE

1. The PIC must be informed of the potential
threat.

2. The FA will discontinue the service of any
alcoholic beverage to the pax.

558 / 845

9.1.32 LEVEL 2 // MODERATE NATURE
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

DESCRIPTION

This pax is verbally abusive and possibly still
uncooperative. Though the situation is awkward it
remains manageable. It is an incident that is
resolved by a crew member only after some
difficulty and which includes but is not limited to:
The repetition of a level 1 incident

The continuation of a level 1 incident by a pax
after being warned by a crew member

The repeated failure of a pax to comply with a
crew member’s safety instructions

Belligerent, obscene or lewd behavior towards
a crew member.

PROCEDURE

1. The PIC must be informed of the potential
threat.

2. Communications between the cabin crew and
flight crew must be maintained on 5 minute
intervals until the problem has passed.

3. In a non-threatening and respectful way, the
FA will inform the pax that he/she will be met
by authorities if he/she continues their
disruptive behavior.

4. The FA will discontinue the service of any

559 / 845

alcoholic beverage to the pax.

560 / 845

9.1.33 LEVEL 3 // SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERNS
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

DESCRIPTION

Is an incident where there are serious safety
concerns for the pax or crew members and which
includes but is not limited to:
Threatening a person on board or about to
board the aircraft or making threats in an
attempt to board the aircraft

The continuation of a level 2 incident that
was unresolved

Tampering with any emergency or safety
equipment on board the a/c

Deliberate damage of any part of the a/c or
any property on board the a/c

Injuring a person on board the a/c

Violent, argumentative, threatening,
intimidating or disorderly behavior, including
harassment and assault,

PROCEDURE

1. This pax is verbally and physically abusive
and certainly unmanageable.

2. At this point, the authorities would be

561 / 845

informed and the flight diverted to the nearest
suitable airport.

562 / 845

9.1.34 LEVEL 4 // SECURITY THREAT
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

DESCRIPTION

Is an incident that constitutes a security threat
and which includes but is not limited to:
An attempted or unauthorized intrusion into
the flight deck

A credible threat of death or serious bodily
injury in an attempt to gain control over the
a/c

The display or use of a weapon

The sabotage of, or the attempt to sabotage
an a/c that renders it incapable of flight or
that is likely to endanger its safety in flight

Any attempt to unlawfully seize control of the
a/c

An incident that is required to be reported
under section 64 of the Canadian Aviation
Security Regulations.

PROCEDURE

1. The moment the crew decides that police
action will be required, contact should be
made with the arrival airport. This will give
the authorities time to meet the a/c with a
prepared and measured response.

563 / 845

564 / 845

9.1.35 INFORMATION REQUIRED TO PASS ON
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

Incident level and description (assault, smoking, violence, sabotage etc.)
Number of persons involved (intoxicated, male/female)
Weapons involved, if any
Injuries or damage caused, if any
Whether the incident has ended or is ongoing
If possible, name and location on the a/c.

565 / 845

9.1.36 GATHERING OF EVIDENCE
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

Gathering of evidence is vital as many cases have failed in or have been withdrawn from court because of insufficient
evidence.
Start to gather evidence as soon as any incident begins to unfold. Jot down some notes about what was said, actions by
the individual and others, and who potential witnesses may be.
The basic rule is record everything! This helps immensely at the end of a stressful flight when pax are disembarking and
the crew has various other tasks to perform. It’s likely that important details may be forgotten when police arrive looking
for the particulars if this has not been done.
Evidence comes in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and all of it has a great effect on how the courts reach their decisions.
There are basically three types of evidence:
Circumstantial: For example, you see a pax leave a smoke-filled washroom, but you didn’t actually see the person
smoking.
Real evidence: For example, you see that pax throw down a cigarette butt. If kept, this will be real evidence – something
the court can actually see.
Best evidence: You could describe the cigarette butt; however, your testimony will be given more weight if the court
actually sees the evidence. That’s the best evidence.

566 / 845

9.1.37 PROCEDURES WHEN POLICE HAVE TO BOARD THE AIRCRAFT TO REMOVE A PA
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

Police will probably advise the crew to keep the pax seated if they have to board the a/c.
It is stressed that pax will not be held up for long, but if an individual has to be removed the whole process will ultimately
be quicker if pax. remain seated.
Officers will be looking for some basic information from a crew member as soon as the door is opened. This will help
police decide whether to allow the individual to disembark normally or to escort them off the a/c.
In order to ensure proper identification, officers will request that a crew member take them to the individual rather than
having them wander around looking for a seat number.
Crew members should also indicate potential witnesses to the officers, bearing in mind that once those pax leave it is
difficult to locate them.
Please be patient. It is understandable that this may be a hard request after a long, tiring flight. Police are sensitive to
this, but ultimately a successful prosecution in court requires a methodical collection of information and evidence.

567 / 845

9.1.38 THE LAW
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

Canadian Law, as it relates to incidents involving an unruly airline pax, is generally clear and comprehensive.
Ultimately, the police decide whether to lay charges or make an arrest based on three main factors:
1. Jurisdiction: where the offence took place or can be tried in court

NOTE: An offence committed on an a/c during the course of a flight is deemed to have been committed at the
place of departure, in any territory that was overflown, and at the territorial division where the flight ends.
(Section 476 (d) Criminal Code). Simply put, no matter where it happened, Canadian Authorities will always have
at least a shared jurisdiction.
2. Type of offence: hybrid (more serious), indictable (most serious) or summary (less serious)
3. Evidence: available evidence to support a charge.

Police may arrest and charge a person when they have reasonable grounds to believe that person has committed an
indictable offence.
When it’s a summary offence, a charge may still be laid, but unless the officers actually see the offence being committed
they cannot make an arrest.

568 / 845

9.1.39 TYPES OF OFFENCES AS PER THE CRIMINAL CODE
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

Criminal Code offences are basically broken down into three categories: indictable, summary and hybrid (which can be
either summary or indictable).
Some of the more common offences are:
Hybrid (generally the more serious offence)
Common assault, assault causing injuries, assault with a weapon, aggravated assault
Uttering threats of death, to cause injury, or to damage property
Mischief (damaging property or causing a loss of use or enjoyment of property)
Interfering with Transportation facilities
Possession of offensive weapons.

Summary (generally the less serious offence)
Causing a disturbance or indecent exhibition
Smoking on-board when prohibited
Refusing to follow in-flight safety instructions
Consuming own alcohol on-board.

Inditable (the most serious offence)
Murder, kidnapping, hijacking, possession of explosives with intent
Aggravated assault, endangering aircraft and many others.

All hybrid offences enable arrest by a Peace Officer as they are treated as indictable initially. The Crown Prosecutor will
decide how they are proceeded with in court.

569 / 845

9.1.40 MANDATORY REPORTING OF INTERFERENCE INCIDENTS
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

In addition to providing biannual statistics to Transport Canada for levels 2, 3 & 4, we also must report internally to our
SMS. Anytime there is an occurrence of Unruly pax / Interference with a crew member it must be reported by the PIC (or
for ground occurrence) the personnel directly involved. The ICFA is also required to submit a report to the SMS.
You must use the approved “Unruly Pax & Interference with a Crew Member” report form. There is a link on the SMS
site and hard copies on each a/c.

570 / 845

9.1.41 DEBRIEFING FOLLOWING INTERFERENCE INCIDENT
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

A full debriefing will take place with all personnel involved to discuss the entire situation, including all aspects of the
incident, noting what went well and what could be improved upon for future incidents.
The PIC/Supervisor / Manager will lead the debriefing session. The debriefing can take place in a private room, either in
our facilities or on the a/c (if away from base).
The time for the debriefing will either be immediately following the incident or at the end of the duty day. The PIC /
Manager / Supervisor will ultimately determine the urgency of the debriefing based upon the severity of the incident and
any trauma experienced by the personnel.
To ensure all aspects of the incident are covered in the debriefing the PIC / Supervisor / Manager will use our official
report form (Incident Report Form Unruly Passenger and Interference with Crew Members) when conducting the
debriefing.
All personnel involved should be encouraged to voice their opinion to their PIC / Manager / Supervisor of any trauma
they may be feeling / experiencing as a result of the incident and to be directed accordingly to our Employee Assistance
Program.

571 / 845

9.1.42 WITNESS STATEMENTS
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

Statements should be solicited from witnesses - names and addresses should be taken in case further contact is
necessary.
When testifying in court, witnesses will state what they personally observed and may be asked to repeat some of what
they heard. Rather than relate the “he was rude or abusive it would be much more helpful if the witness was able to
repeat the exact or explicit words used.
Advise them they may be required to testify sometime after the event took place, so it’s important to keep original notes.
This will allow the witness to use the notes in court for relevant details.

572 / 845

9.1.43 REMOVAL OF PASSENGERS
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

When a pax’s conduct or condition is considered to endanger the safety or comfort of the other pax’s or the safety of the
flight, that pax must be restricted or removed from the flt. Should it be necessary to deplane or remove a pax from any
flight for any reason, the following rules will apply:
The PIC shall decide whether or not to remove the pax and if removal can safely be delayed until the next enroute
stop or whether an unscheduled stop at the nearest airport is required.
On the ground the decision of removal will be made jointly by the station agent and the Captain.
Crew members will not actively assist in the removal of the pax unless participation cannot be avoided.
The Captain will instruct and / or advise as to arrangements to be made for the safe removal and after care of the
pax.
When the a/c is on the ground and it has been decided to remove the pax, the employees assigned by the station
agent under direct supervision of the captain shall attempt to persuade the pax to deplane voluntarily.
If all efforts of persuasion fail, the pax shall be removed by a Law Enforcement agency only.
Incapacitated pax will be removed on a stretcher, if necessary.
Under no circumstances will any assault, injury or mistreatment of a pax by an employee be tolerated and all
reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that such is not accomplished by a third party.

to boarding. The final decision regarding the transportation of a person(s) in custody of an escort(s) rests with Air Tindi
and the Captain.
The following procedures apply:
The prisoner and escort will be pre-boarded.
Prior to the flight, the F/A will be notified of the prisoner’s seat and will conduct a search of the area including the
seat pocket, seat cushion etc. for potential weapons.
The prisoner should be seated in the rear of the aircraft and not at an emergency exit.
The escort will be seated in the aisle seat adjacent to the prisoner.
The prisoner may not leave their seat without the escort.
The company is not responsible for the custody or supervision of a prisoner. The escort must accompany the
prisoner to and from the lavatories and maintain surveillance at all times.
When possible, the seat in front of the prisoner will remain empty.
The escort and prisoner will normally remain on-board the aircraft during station stops.
The F/A will check with the escort in regards to in-flight service items to offer.
At no time will alcohol be served.
The prisoner will not be handcuffed to any part of the aircraft.
The prisoner and escort will be deplaned last.

9.1.46 WEAPONS
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

Regulations which outline the provisions to be adhered to by peace officers and air carriers in the transportation of
firearms on-board are as follows:
A peace officer authorized to carry an unloaded firearm aboard a particular flight shall:
Notify the company of the fact as soon as possible before departure of the flight.
Identify himself/ herself to the company by presenting credentials that include his/her clear, full face picture, his/her
signature and the signature of an authorized official of the organization that employs him/her.
The Flight Coordinator will complete a “Notice to Armed Individuals” form and provide the form to the Captain or
Flight Attendant, when applicable, who will in turn notify the Captain of the presence on board of an armed officer.
Alcoholic beverages must not be offered or served to the peace officer.

NOTE: If a second peace officer is carried who has a firearm accessible to him, they will be told of each other’s
presence discreetly by the F/A.
However, if a Peace Officer is on board in an undercover or covert capacity, and has access to a weapon and requests
that other persons are not informed, this must be complied with. The PIC is the only person who can be informed.

576 / 845

9.1.47 WEAPONS // FIREARMS ON BOARD

Unloaded firearms may be carried in the cabin by peace officers or officers of the Canadian Armed Forces.
Unloaded weapons may be carried by passengers as checked baggage only and they will be asked to complete a
Firearms Declaration Form.

Although hunting knives, hatchets, swords and other such items are not considered to be weapons by law, they will not
be permitted in the cabin of the a/c. Such items will be taken from the pax prior to boarding and placed in the baggage
area.
Passengers with unauthorized weapons must not be approached directly. If you believe that a pax is carrying a weapon,
make no comment to the pax, but report it to the Captain.
“Notice to Armed Individuals” must be completed by the company and given to the F/A.

577 / 845

The Captain will be advised.
The deportee will be pre-boarded to ensure they are on the a/c.
It must be a non-stop flight to the deportees destination.
The deportee must have no criminal record or history of violent behavior.

578 / 845

9.1.49 SABOTAGE // VANDALISM and PREVENTATIVE MEASURES ON THE GROUND
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

The definition of sabotage is: an act that seeks to cause damage to equipment (vehicle / aircraft), or installations, or to
prevent the aircraft or apparatus from functioning normally.
The definition of vandalism is: to destroy or deface (as public or private property) willfully or maliciously.
In the course of your duties prior to flight, crew members should be alert to signs of vandalism which may indicate
unauthorized entry or tampering with the a/c or the airport facilities / equipment.
While an a/c is on the ground care should be taken to prevent unauthorized access, sabotage or other threats against the
a/c.
The following outlines preventative measures to be taken to protect an a/c while on the ground.
Communication between crew members on an ongoing basis is essential to maintaining security.
At any time that any crew member has a sixth sense that something is not quite right, this should be communicated
to other crew members. Trust your instincts.
If abnormal pax behavior is observed at time of boarding, the ICFA should be advised, and in turn, the PIC of
the a/c.

When communicating on board an a/c, employ discretion at all times. Pax’s can often overhear communication over
an interphone system. For this reason, when possible, communicate personally in a buffet / galley or more secluded
area of the a/c.
When any level of security alert exists, all crew members should be advised in order to make them sensitive to any
minor occurrences that though normally would not be considered threatening, should in the present circumstance be
noted and passed along.
When conducting PFSC’s of the a/c and equipment, cabin crew should be alert for any parcels or objects that are
not normally on board. If any item found on board is suspect as to its origin or purpose, do not touch it and advise
the PIC immediately. Look (without touching) for any noticeable characteristics: size, color, wires, sound etc. and
provide this information to the PIC, as it may be of value to authorities;
The PIC upon report of an unidentified object on board will notify ATC and request ground assistance from law
enforcement and if available, on-site experts trained in the management of explosive devices.
In addition the F/D crew will conduct an external inspection of the a/c to identify anything out of the norm and convey
that information to the law enforcement.
In times of security alert, or where evidence of tampering or unauthorized access to the a/c has occurred, a more indepth inspection of the a/c is necessary.
If sabotage or vandalism was discovered prior to departure, the PIC should return to the departure point at the
gate and notify company authorities immediately. Depending on the nature of the sabotage suspected, passengers

should be deplaned with the assistance of ground personnel.

9.1.52 BOMB THREAT // GENERAL
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

The aviation industry receives many bomb threats against its operations each year, normally in the form of a warning that
a bomb has been placed in an a/c or an airport.
Almost all such warnings turn out to be hoaxes but all have to be treated seriously and assessed according to criteria
agreed between the industry and the Ministry of Transport.
Company personnel will treat all bomb threats as genuine, unless the evidence overwhelmingly indicates otherwise.
Air Tindi is responsible for assessing and categorizing bomb threats. There are 2 types of bomb threats, specific and
non-specific.
An air carrier that receives a threat to an aviation facility or to any part of an aerodrome under its control shall
determine that the threat is a specific threat if the text of the threat contains a specific reference to the facility or part of
the aerodrome in addition to any of the following:
Information on the construction of an explosive or incendiary device
Information about the individual or organization responsible for the threat
Information about an individual who is the intended target of the threat
Industry terminology or non-public information that indicates a unique knowledge of the target or possible location of
an explosive or incendiary device.
Actions subsequent to receipt of such a threat will continue to its normal conclusion, unless cancelling instructions are
issued by the DFO or designate.
When an a/c inflight is the subject of a bomb threat it will be treated as a potential and expected major accident and
the procedures for handling accidents will be followed.
A threat inflight is a specific threat if the text of the threat contains either of the following:

583 / 845

The flight number and flight departure time, or
The flight number and actual location of the a/c at the time the threat was received and any of the following:
The aircraft registration number or tail number
The name of a crew member assigned to the a/c or flight in relation to which the threat was received
A valid baggage tag number
Industry terminology or non-public information that indicates a unique knowledge of the target or
possible location of an explosive or incendiary device.
A non-specific threat is more general in nature such as “there is a bomb on one of your a/c”. Because a non-specific
threat is received it does not mean it is a hoax.

9.1.53 BOMB THREAT COMMUNICATION PROCEDURES EITHER ON THE GROUND OR INF
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

In the event that a F/A becomes aware of a threat to security made by a passenger, the F/A will advise the PIC
immediately. This communication should be done by interphone in emergency mode. Caution should be taken in using
the interphone because passengers may overhear the conversation. Also be aware that a passenger who makes a threat
against a flight may have one or more accomplices on board therefore, keep communication guarded.
If the F/D becomes aware of a threat, they shall advise the ICFA by use of emergency communication. Whenever
possible the F/D crew and ICFA should review at a minimum the following:
Type of emergency – specifics of the threat
Need to evacuate or rapid deplanement
Signal to evacuate or rapid deplanement
Time frame
When to evacuate or rapid deplanement
Any special instructions.

9.1.54 BOMB THREAT PROCEDURES ON THE GROUND
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

Once communications have been relayed, a plan established and the ICFA has briefed with the other F/A, the following
will apply:
Whenever possible, rapid deplanement should be employed as less injuries will occur to pax’s and crew than during
an evacuation.
If a command for evacuation is issued, follow your approved procedures for evacuation (shouted commands, exit
assessment, exit operation, pax control, equipment responsibilities, crew evacuation, post evacuation duties etc.).
If a command for rapid deplanement is issued, the ICFA should advise the pax’s of the need to rapid deplane and
gather the pax well away from the a/c at least 300 feet upwind. (See “suggested announcement” on next page).
Upon completion of the announcement, the MPD should be opened and pax’s deplaned.
When all pax’s have left the a/c, the ICFA should make a final inspection of the cabin to ensure that all pax’s have
left the a/c, and should then gather emergency equipment (as assigned) and leave the a/c.
Gather pax’s at a minimum of 300 feet upwind of the a/c or other safe holding zone as directed to do so by the PIC.
The ICFA should perform a head count.
Crew members will be called upon to identify any pax’s whose behavior was out of the norm prior to receipt of the
threat.

Cabin crew and Air crew should not participate in a search or inspection of the a/c after a deplanement or
evacuation. This search and inspection is the responsibility of airport authorities or bomb disposal experts who have
received specific training.
As each and every a/c is different, the personnel trained in bomb disposal may not be familiar with our particular a/c.
For this reason, these individuals should be provided with the a/c inspection checklist(s) that the F/D crew and cabin
crew complete prior to departure.

In some instances where time permits the Captain may direct a search of the cabin for any suspected object. If a search
is required the following will apply:
Ensure the Fasten Seatbelt sign is on and that all pax’s are in compliance.
Under strict row-by-row control, the pax’s should be called upon to identify their on board baggage in an attempt to
find a suspicious object.
A bomb search should be conducted with EXTREME CAUTION. Use flashlights and mirrors when searching in
confined dark areas. The objective of the search is to look for something out of place. Individuals conducting the
search should be familiar with the physical layout and contents of the a/c. Although the object may look like an actual
bomb, it may also be a book, box, briefcase, bag, pen, MP3 player, computer or almost anything.
A checklist should be used to search the a/c.
Search all quick-latch or easy-access doors as well as equipment areas. If a door, compartment or piece of
equipment is properly sealed and there is no evidence of tampering, a further search may not be necessary.
Remember a suspect article requires the utmost CAUTION. If it cannot be readily identified, do not touch or
disturb it without professional guidance.

9.1.62 IF A SUSPECT DEVICE IS FOUND
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

The finder would provide the PIC with a sketch and a written description of the suspect device. This additional information
will be radioed to ATC to assist the bomb disposal experts in their evaluation.
LOCATION? SIZE? DISTINGUISHING FEATURES? SOUND? SMELL?
After informing the PIC advise him / her that you will:
Allow no one to touch the suspect device. Explosive devices can be very sophisticated. Anti-handling devices
and anti-penetrating systems may be included, making any attempt at manipulating the device highly dangerous.
Keep the device exactly in place and in the attitude in which it is found. Though very sensitive vibration switch-type
bombs are not expected o/b a/c inflight, less sensitive types requiring perhaps a 90 degree change of attitude have
been encountered.
Stabilize it in the position found so that it will not be able to move during descent and landing and place pillows
and wetted blankets (or other absorbent material) on and around it. This will reduce the fragmentation and fire
potential. Leave the device undisturbed for EOD experts to deal with after landing.
Non-essential power in the area near the device is to be disconnected.
Move pax’s as far away from the device as possible.
The PIC must establish and maintain communications between the a/c, ATC and company flight operations.
The PIC must adjust the altitude, if terrain permits, so that inside-outside pressures can be equalized without
changing the existing cabin pressure.
Land and evacuate the a/c.

9.1.63 HIJACKING
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

Hijacking, which is an act of air piracy, is an illegal takeover of an aircraft by person or persons on board, threatening
the safety of the a/c or its passengers. It is important to realize that a hijacked aircraft is an aircraft in distress and the
hijacker is committing a CRIMINAL CODE OFFENCE. The possibility exists that any Canadian air carrier may fall victim
to an attempted hijacking.
While there are guidelines in place for the management of a hijacking situation, experience in the industry has shown that
no two situations are alike. Crew member actions may have to be modified based on each and every separate
incident.
It should be noted that all decisions as to the conduct of the flight when taken over by a hijacker must be made by the PIC
according to his / her judgment and assessment of the situation.
SAFETY IS THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
The following tactics, based upon actual hijack cases, are intended as a guide to handling hijacker’s and should be
modified as the situation dictates.

596 / 845

9.1.64 NOTIFYING THE PIC OF A HIJACKING SITUATION
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

Where an individual makes him / herself known with the intent of hijacking an aircraft, the PIC must be notified as
soon as possible.
If a F/A has reason to suspect a hijacking, he or she will inform the PIC by the following method.
The F/A will signal the F/D by pulling the emergency call button out and up. A light will flash and a chime will sound
in the cockpit indicating the urgency of the call.
When answering the call and receiving NO response from the F/A this will indicate there is a problem in the cabin
where the F/A cannot initiate a call to the F/D.
The F/D crew will then call the F/A by interphone, at which time the F/A will try to answer using the code word
established in the pre-flight briefing. If there is no answer a hijacking situation is assumed.
When the a/c is in a full configuration, the PIC will advise the F/O to do a discreet visual check of the cabin via the
window viewer in the door to gain an initial assessment of the situation.

597 / 845

9.1.65 INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED TO THE PIC

Try to obtain as much information as possible, such as:
Number of hijackers: observed or claimed, ground based or in the air
Weapons: observed or claimed
Description of hijacker (s): age, race, gender, language, physical state (drugged / intoxicated) and emotional state,
distinguishing features (tattoo, beard, glasses)
Demands: record them to avoid future misunderstandings;
Other pertinent data: home address, name of family or friends, seat number, situation assessment.

Beware also of the possibility of “sleepers or covert accomplices” among the passengers, and do not discount
the possibility that they could be women or even children.

598 / 845

9.1.66 CABIN PROCEDURES and GENERAL TACTICS DURING A HIJACKING
9. SECURITY
9.1 Security

The Fasten seatbelt sign should be on to ensure that passengers remain in their seats. This will lessen the
possibility of additional risks.
If possible, attempt to keep hijacker in their seat.
If communications with the PIC are demanded, communicate via the interphone only.
If the hijacker demands access into the F/D, explain that since 911 the a/c has been retrofitted with automatic
locking doors that will not open inflight. The only way they could gain access into the F/D is to land the plane, open
the MPD and that action will then automatically release the locking mechanism of the F/D door.
If the hijacker does manage to gain access into the F/D, the F/A should try to be a buffer between the hijacker and
the air crew and carry out the following steps;
Make no sudden moves and explain all actions.
The great slowdown / stalling for time
Calming the hijacker using Passive Resistance / Passive Control as a successful defence tactic.
Becoming the hijacker’s neutral friend, blaming policy or regulations when you must oppose him / her.
Encouraging the hijacker to talk by overloading him / her with questions, problems that he / she must decide.
Offer no technical advice.
Provide plenty of non-alcoholic beverages to create a bathroom need.
Avoid forceful resistance, unless absolutely necessary.
Avoid antagonizing or arguing with the hijacker, especially on political matters.
Avoid referring to insanity or mental disorders.
Avoid becoming mentally aligned with the hijackers or their cause (Stockholm Syndrome).
Avoid making unusual physical movement unless the hijacker understands why in advance.
Avoid making the hijacker feel cornered.
Do update the PIC with any additional information whenever possible.

that permission is given by the hijacker. Any prolonged absence should be explained to the hijackers.
Try to persuade the hijacker(s) to allow the unloading of pax, F/A and baggage in order to increase fuel capacity and
therefore fly further. Use whatever tactics possible to get the pax and crew off the a/c.
If bar contents are o/b, they should be offloaded at the first opportunity.
Cite fuel and mechanical problems to assist in the slowdown.

10.1.1 EMERGENCY EVACUATION PROCEDURES // GENERAL
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

The reaction of the passengers during an emergency is largely dependent upon the composure and ability of the
F/A’s to carry out their duties.
The most important aspect of passenger behavior in an emergency is that the F/A’s must keep pax assured and not
allow anyone to panic.
In some instances, the survival of pax is largely dependent on the behavior of the F/A’s. Know your emergency
procedures and be totally familiar with the aircraft and all of its safety features. The speed, accuracy and manner in
which pax are evacuated may mean the difference between a disaster and an incident.
The variable nature of each emergency landing or evacuation can make it impossible to set down definitive
procedures. Therefore, the following procedures contained in this chapter are guidelines, and proper assessment of the
situation will dictate the need for sound judgment and crew coordination, and the specific course of action to be followed.
Each crew member must know the duties and responsibilities expected of him / her during an emergency. In addition, he /
she should familiarize himself / herself with the duties and responsibilities of the other crew members so that he /
she can assume those duties if necessary.
It must be realized that other crew members may be unconscious or injured when making an emergency landing. The
assuming of another’s duties should be done immediately and positively, when the necessity for it is realized.
You must always maintain situational awareness of what is happening around you and be prepared to act
immediately if an emergency should arise. Different conditions can exist which can aggravate the emergency, and these
must be dealt with as they are recognized.
There could be fire inside or outside the cabin, blocked exits or areas of the cabin divided off. There could be dense
smoke, toxic fumes or both accompanied by fire. There could be total darkness or loud noises, both hindering passenger
and crew in locating and activating exits and evacuation. There could be structural damage and the a/c could come to
rest at an unusual attitude making it awkward to move about the cabin.
No one gets ready for an emergency in a moment. What a person does in an emergency is determined by what he or
she has done for a long time. Since we are all “creatures of habit”, training, emergency procedures and check lists are
stressed repeatedly.
Knowledge of the operation and location of all emergency exits and equipment is the first step to a successful emergency
evacuation.
Pre-flight briefing assures readiness for any emergency that might arise during a particular flight. It is pre-planning that
saves valuable time during an emergency when actions of the crew must harmonize to assure success. Basic to that
success is correct knowledge, current information and a proper briefing. Knowledgeable planning will save the maximum
number of lives in a difficult situation.
It is not sufficient to merely know the location of emergency equipment or how to use it. What is equally important is,
knowing the proper sequence of actions and resourceful communications to be taken to manage the requirements
of the particular situation.
Crew knowledge and “Effective Leadership” are the most important factors identified in producing escapes. This is basic

604 / 845

to the emergency and is the same for each a/c. Only the size of the crew varies with the size of the a/c.
In an accident, once the a/c comes to a complete stop, the one vital factor is TIME. If fire occurs there may be as little as
50 – 120 seconds of survival atmosphere within the cabin. Therefore, time must never be wasted.
Many emergencies are a result of Take-Off or Landing incidents and they tend to develop with bewildering speed.
There are many clues which will warn a F/A when an emergency situation is developing, and they should be on the alert
to recognize and interpret these clues. This is also why each F/A is assigned seats as near the doors and window exits
as possible. In an emergency, these exits can be quickly assessed and opened, and the pax evacuated with the minimum
of delay. Recognizing the accident as it is happening largely eliminates the risk of delay caused by shock.
Never underestimate the seriousness of a situation. The F/D crew may be incapacitated or a/c damage may prevent them
from reaching the cabin, therefore, the F/A must be ready to take immediate action in initiating an evacuation.
Responsibility for initiation and effecting a successful evacuation depends entirely on the coordination between all flight
personnel and on the efficiency with which they follow laid down procedures, as well as on the physical ability to carry-out
these procedures when the a/c comes to rest.
Again with the survival of the pax so dependent upon the F/A, it is imperative that you protect yourself as much as
possible, by occupying your approved jumpseat provided for you and make full use of the seatbelt and shoulder
harnesses.
When in your seats and properly secured, you are further conditioning yourself by conducting your mandatory “Silent
Review”. This helps to put you in a state of readiness and preparedness and eventual control.

605 / 845

10.1.2 PASSENGER PSYCHOLOGY & PASSENGER CONTROL
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

The reaction of the pax during an emergency is largely dependent upon the behavior, composure and ability of the F/A’s
to carry out their duties.
The proper preparations and control of a full complement of pax may only be accomplished by cooperative efforts. It must
be impressed upon pax that the crew is fully trained and competent to manage the situation, including pax requirement to
cooperate with all instructions to ensure the successful outcome.
Keeping pax assured and allowing no one to panic is one of the most important aspects of an emergency. Strict
supervision of all pax will be necessary to avoid panic and confusion. A F/A should always be on the lookout and be
prepared for pax who tend to panic as they are a danger to the morale of all. Calm them gently at first, but forcibly if
necessary.
When addressing the pax with emergency instructions, ensure that your manner and voice instills confidence. Speak
slowly and clearly, choosing your words carefully. Demonstrate that you and your fellow crew members are fully trained
and competent to handle the situation.
If the a/c PA system is inoperative, proceed to the front of the cabin, face the pax and make all announcements from this
position. Make the announcements as often as necessary until you are sure all pax have heard and understood them.
In an emergency situation people have to be told in clear, concise and precise words what to do. Even if you had time to
brief, the shock, confusion and fear will delay their response.
Emphasize that total cooperation on the part of each pax will ensure the safety of all. Never forget to let the pax know that
rescue is close at hand, even if there appears to be no reason to believe this is true. Comforting the pax in this or any
other way will make the emergency more bearable for them.

606 / 845

10.1.3 PASSENGER PANIC // GENERAL
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

In evacuations, panic has killed or injured more people than the actual emergency event itself. People in a state of panic
are rarely able to save themselves. If you understand what’s going on, what to do, where to go and how to get there,
panic will not set in. Positive commands and strong leadership are the best defense against panic.
Past emergency landing investigations indicate that some pax’s become hysterical, while others were in a state of shock
and disbelief.
Pax’s in shock could not think clearly. For example, they couldn’t get out of their seats because they did not realize that
their seatbelts were still fastened. Sometimes it will be necessary to lead them by hand in order to get them out.
Other pax’s tend to panic and become quite irrational in their attempts to get off the a/c. If their actions become a
hindrance, you may take action (i.e. shaking or restrain), in order to facilitate the overall evacuation.

607 / 845

10.1.4 TWO TYPES OF PASSENGER PANIC & ASSOCIATED FACTORS // GENERAL
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

Panic has come to imply an overwhelming fear that spreads quickly throughout the crowd, creating chaos.
There are two types of passenger panic referred to as “NEGATIVE PANIC and POSITIVE PANIC”.
The associated factor of “NEGATIVE PANIC” is that it is “SPONTANEOUS”.
The associated factor of “POSITIVE PANIC” is that it is “CONTAGIOUS”.
NEGATIVE PANIC
This type of panic is usually easy to determine. A pax suffering from negative panic will remain seated or act bewildered
and will not be making any apparent effort to save his life. People in a state of panic are rarely able to save themselves.
SPONTANEOUS
Panic is the product of your imagination running wild and it will set in as soon as it dawns on you that you’re lost,
disorientated or you don’t know what to do?
POSITIVE PANIC
This can be a definite hindrance to a F/A who is trying to evacuate the a/c. Pax’s in positive panic will most likely try to
take charge and actually disrupt your evacuation. They may give false information to pax’s and create confusion. The
strongest social bonds may be temporarily broken; mothers may leave their infants. Some persons may injure or kill
others in an effort to survive, in spite of the possible consequences of their actions.
CONTAGIOUS
In respect of behavior breeds behavior this type of panic is easily transmitted from one person to another. F/A’s should
be prepared for this type of hysteria and deal with it before it is transmitted to others. This should be dealt with
diplomatically or, where necessary, with force.

608 / 845

10.1.5 TYPES OF EMERGENCY LANDINGS
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

There are two types of emergency landings that result in evacuation. They will take place on either land or water, and
will occur in two separate forms.
1. Unprepared / Unplanned = Are those that take place with little or no warnings.
2. Prepared / Planned = Are those where there is time to prepare.

609 / 845

10.1.6 UNPREPARED / UNPLANNED EMERGENCY LANDING
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

This is a land or inadvertent water impact that occurs during the take-off or landing phase of flight with no time to
prepare. This type is more likely to occur and is also the most critical. A successful outcome will depend entirely on the
competency of the flight personnel.
Most accidents occur in the first three (3) minutes of take-off and the last eight (8) minutes of the flight. During these
times, F/A’s need to be especially alert for any unexpected emergency.
The unprepared / unplanned emergency is an unexpected situation with limited or no time available for preparation. The
unprepared / unplanned emergency is far more likely to occur than the prepared / planned emergency.
You must never become complacent! Before take-off and landing spend time reviewing procedures (Silent Review) to
program your mind for emergencies that could occur.
If something does happen, the surprise factor will be greatly reduced and you will be mentally prepared to respond
faster to the emergency with the correct decisions.
In order to recognize emergencies F/A’s should always maintain situational awareness and be alert to four (4) general
clues:
SIGHT: fire, sparks, smoke
SOUNDS: strange noises, surges of power
SMELLS: smoke, excessive fuel fumes
A/C ATTITUDE: position of the a/c relative to the runway / horizon.

There can be some benefits to an unprepared / unplanned emergency:
You are at the airport and help is close by
You are traveling at slower speeds and are close to the ground (or on the ground)
You conducted your PFSC and know that your equipment is serviceable and ready for immediate use
You’re a/c is in a “Clean Configuration” which means that all required safety checks have been completed and
verified, all pax have been briefed on all of the safety features of the a/c, there is no garbage, COB or other debris
loose in the cabin that would hinder the evacuation flow, and you are secured in your assigned seat maintaining
situational awareness and conducting your silent review.

610 / 845

10.1.7 PREPARED / PLANNED EMERGENCY LANDING
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

This is a land or ditching onto water impact where there is time available to brief and prepare the crew, pax and cabin.
These types of emergency evacuations usually proceed in an orderly manner with a minimum amount of injury or loss of
life.
Certain procedures carry more importance than others, depending upon the time available to prepare for the evacuation
and where the evacuation is likely to take place (land versus water impact and at an airport versus away from an airport).

611 / 845

10.1.8 FLIGHT ATTENDANT INITIATION OF EVACUATION
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

F/A’s are not normally to initiate an evacuation unless instructed by the Captain, as procedures dictate that the Captain
will give the command to evacuate which may include which side or end of the a/c to evacuate from.
The evacuation procedures have been laid out in such a manner that, in extreme circumstances, F/A’s have the authority
to initiate an evacuation.
Prior to an evacuation without a command from the F/D, a F/A shall attempt communication with the F/D. Consideration
must be given to confirming life threatening conditions and checking the F/D if accessible. F/A’s will be ready to take
immediate action and initiate an evacuation.
Should one F/A hear or see another F/A initiating an evacuation, the other F/A should confirm and then immediately start
evacuation procedures.

10.1.9 RAPID DEPLANEMENT or RAPID DEPLANE versus EVACUATION // GENERAL
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

Emergency landings or other abnormal conditions do not always necessitate the need for an emergency evacuation.
When the situation is not immediately life threatening, the PIC and ICFA should opt for a rapid deplanement of the pax as
opposed to a full on Evacuation.

613 / 845

10.1.10 RAPID DEPLANEMENT // RAPID DEPLANE

In the event of an emergency, the PIC and F/O will be concerned primarily with their own duties in the Flight Deck.
However, after landing the F/D crew will be able to assist with the evacuation.
The PIC will proceed through the F/D door (if accessible) with an extinguisher in hand.
The PIC will scan the rows and side walls on his way through the cabin to check for any injured or SPAT pax’s.
The PIC will ensure all pax are out.
If the F/D door is not accessible the PIC will evacuate through the F/D escape window/roof hatch as applicable to the
aircraft exit.
The PIC and F/O will assist with the evacuation outside of the a/c.
The PIC and F/O (if safe to do so) will retrieve emergency equipment considered necessary for post evacuation
purposes depending on where the a/c landed. For example, off the airport, take the survival kits.

10.1.15 EVACUATION ROUTES & EXIT PRIORITY
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

Abnormal or emergency landings can be the result of a variety of causes. These can vary in severity from essentially
normal landings in which little or no damage is sustained by the a/c, to landings of a disastrous nature during which the
a/c is destroyed.
Evacuation may be necessary following a landing with the gear up, down or partially extended. Depending on the type of
landing, the route to follow in evacuating the a/c can vary considerably.
Use the safest and quickest route. Pax must be directed clear away from the a/c at least 300 feet upwind. If an
exit becomes blocked, move to another available exit. If your exit dries up and pax are bottlenecked at another
exit, shout! and get them moving towards your exit.
All serviceable exits will normally be used unless they are damaged, near a fire, or unless the PIC advises otherwise.
It is difficult to establish hard and fast procedures regarding which exits to use, as the emergency will govern the situation.
Because of the many conceivable emergencies, especially in the area of the undercarriage malfunction or fuselage fire,
evacuation instructions are necessarily of a general nature. It is therefore possible that during operations for such as
emergency landings, the PIC, for good and valid reasons dictated by the circumstances, may give his cabin crew
instructions which may differ from those listed in this manual. Departures from laid down procedures are most likely
to occur with regard to the disposition of pax and crew and intentions with emergency exits before and after landing.
Where unusual a/c attitudes are involved (single / multiple gear collapse), F/A’s are to assess the suitability of their exits
on an individual basis. Preferably exits which are closest to the ground. In any case, use the safest and quickest route.
Move away from the a/c and remain in a group.
Door exits are normally preferable on land as it takes 10-12 seconds longer to evacuate through a window than
through a door. With less than a full load of pax and time and seating allowance permits, move pax nearer to the door
exits for land emergencies.
In a ditching or inadvertent water situation however, due to the attitude (tail and one wing down), the a/c will take in water.
The MPD and Rear Starboard Exit are never to be opened in a ditching or inadvertent water landing. In addition, the
F/A’s must ensure that only the window exit(s) which are above water level are opened.
Many different conditions exist which can aggravate the situation, hindering pax and crew from locating and activating
exits and evacuations. These conditions must be dealt with as soon as they are recognized.
There could be:
Fire inside and / or outside of the cabin
Blocked exits or areas divided off
Dense smoke and toxic fumes with fire
Total darkness

619 / 845

Loud noises
Structural damage
A/C could come to rest at an unusual attitude, making it awkward to move about
Strange vibrations not normally experienced.

In any evacuation or rapid deplane, and prior to opening any exit an assessment must be made to determine that
engines are shut down and conditions outside of the exit are safe.
Never open any exit where there is fire, high water, dangerous debris or any hazard with the potential to cause
injury.

10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

In any emergency situation, human behavior is unpredictable. Where the suddenness of the incident will not permit
advanced preparation for an orderly and organized evacuation, there is a definite need for the implementation of
authority to counteract panic and confusion.
A calm person, under normal conditions may lose control in an abnormal situation. One individual may be sufficient to
easily spread panic to the other passengers. Sensing their lives in danger, passengers may in turn become
uncontrollable, aggressive and hysterical, with one thought in mind – to get out of this aircraft!

YOU MUST TAKE CONTROL OF THE SITUATION OR THE PASSENGERS WILL!
In many emergency situations commands shouted to passengers contributed to a safe and speedy evacuation.
Commands must be constantly repeated to ensure instructions are heard, understood and followed through.
WHAT IS A COMMAND?
A command is a verbal directive voiced with authority. Commands are intended to instill order in an evacuation, in other
words, to calmly but quickly instruct passengers.
TO ENSURE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS COMMANDS MUST BE:

CLEAR

Not too fast so that they are understood;

SHORT

No more than five words (ideally) to convey the
message;

POSITIVE

To avoid misunderstanding. Avoid using
negative commands; (i.e. instead of saying
“unfasten your seatbelt” where the pax may
think they heard you say “fasten your seatbelt”,
we say “release belts”

ACCURATE

To avoid confusion; and

LOUD

To ensure they can be heard.

WHY DO WE USE COMMANDS?
1. To direct pax to brace for impact
2. To direct pax to available exits
3. To effectively evacuate pax from the a/c.

628 / 845

As we know, most accidents occur during take-off or landing with little or no advance warning. Cabin crew must act
immediately and if necessary initiate the evacuation. There is no time to refer to the procedures. In an emergency, people
have to be told what to do. The only type of direction the F/A’s will be able to give the pax’s are shouted commands,
short and concise and repeated as necessary.

629 / 845

10.1.22 BRACE POSITION SHOUT COMMANDS
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

While the a/c is still in motion, whether you have received a signal from the F/D or have interpreted the possible clues,
you need to get your pax in the best possible position for impact. Shout the following:

NOTE: For pax occupying seats adjacent to the exits, where there is additional space to bend forward further,
you would tell them to GRAB ANKLES!, not Grab Seat Top.

630 / 845

10.1.23 SHOUT COMMANDS FOR MAIN PASSENGER DOOR // LAND EVACUATION
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

Once the a/c has come to a complete stop and you hear Evacuate! Evacuate!, or 5 or more chimes, or you interpret
clues as life threatening, get out of your seat TURN ON THE ELS (Emergency Light Switch) and shout the following:

After assessing inside and outside and it is determined that there are no hazards:
DHC-7
OPEN THE MPD. Pull the floor handle UP. Push the stairs OUT. Rotate upper door handle LEFT and push the door UP
and OUT.
DHC-8
OPEN THE MPD. Push the door handle UP. Push the stairs OUT.
You now need to establish ABP’s at the bottom of your exit to help the rest of the pax off and send them away. Shout the
following to the first 2 people you see:

631 / 845

Once exit is open, serviceable and ABP’s established at the bottom, the ICFA shall get into the protective position and

There is a possibility that your exit is not safe from danger or is jammed and you cannot get it open. In this case, you will
need to redirect pax to another serviceable exit.
Use SEAR to remember what to do: SHOUT! ELEVATE! ASSESS! REDIRECT!

It is recommended to have someone guard the exit so no one attempts to open it. Shout the following to an ABP:

Redirect the pax to the next serviceable exit you can see. You may have to physically turn them around, and shout the
following:

10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

Once the a/c has come to a complete stop and you hear Evacuate! Evacuate!, or 5 or more chimes, or you interpret
clues as life threatening, get out of your seat and shout the following:

After assessing inside outside and it is determined that there are no hazards:
DHC-7 OPEN THE REAR STARBOARD DOOR EXIT. Pull handles UP. Let door DROP.
DHC-8 OPEN THE FORWARD EMERGENCY EXIT R1. Pull down on upper operating handle on door. Place other
hand in the handhold on the bottom of the door. Lift door inward. Turn door sideways and eject it through
opening-use caution to keep exit clear.
You now need to establish an ABP at the bottom of your exit to move the door out of the way and to help the rest of the
pax off and send them away. Shout the following to the first person you see:

634 / 845

Once exit is open, serviceable and ABP established at the bottom, get into protective position and shout the following to
get passengers coming to and out of this exit:

Continue shouting until all pax have evacuated or exit becomes blocked.

10.1.26 SHOUT COMMANDS FOR WINDOW EXIT // LAND EVACUATION
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

Prior to departure and door closing, you have already briefed pax occupying seats adjacent to the window exits
on how to operate it. However, should you see that the pax have not opened the window exits and you assessed
that it is safe to do, shout the following, (you would shout these commands after you have got the flow of pax
starting to evacuate out of the door exits):

Once exit is open, serviceable and ABP established at the bottom shout the following to get passengers coming to and
out of this exit:

Continue shouting until all pax have evacuated or exit becomes blocked.

636 / 845

10.1.27 DITCHING // INADVERTENT WATER CONTACT SHOUT COMMANDS
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

A ditching is the term used when an a/c lands in the water. It may be either prepared (ditching) or unprepared
(inadvertent). It is vital to address the importance that if a ditching were necessary, at least 2 impacts will occur and that
the second impact will be the most severe.
On the DHC-7, iIn a ditching, due to the attitude of the a/c (tail low and one wing down), the rear door exits are not
suitable for use. You must ensure that any exits that are used are above the water line.
Floatation aids are available to pax in that the seat bottom cushion is a floatation device. Crew seats are not equipped
with floatation seat bottom cushions, therefore all crew are provided with a life vest.
It is a CARs requirement that when flying more than 50 nautical miles off shore that life vests are provided, and when
flying more than 300 nautical miles off shore that life rafts are provided.
Air Tindi is not required to meet this CAR requirement at the present time as we do not fly more than 50 or 300 nautical
miles off shore.
To help minimize the effects of hypothermia in a ditching or inadvertent water landing, try to keep pax close together.
When in the water, you should have them huddle together, by placing one arm around the other persons shoulder and
leaving one arm hugging the seat cushion. This will reduce the flow of water around them in turn body temperatures may
not drop quite so rapidly.
(pic)
Once the a/c has come to a complete stop and you hear Evacuate! Evacuate!, or 5 or more chimes, or you interpret
clues as life threatening, get out of your seat, don your life vest (if unprepared) and the ICFA must TURN ON THE ELS
(Emergency Light Switch). Both F/A’s shout the following:

DHC-7 Aft Doors Blocking
When 2 F/A’s are crewed, the #2 F/A will remain in the rear and block the aft door exits. The ICFA will move to the first
row aft or forward of the window exit and direct the evacuation from there.
If only 1 F/A is crewed you need to designate an ABP to remain at the back and block the 2 door exits. Shout the
following:

637 / 845

While continuing to shout REMAIN SEATED UNTIL EXITS ARE READY! The ICFA goes to a row of seats either 1 row
forward or aft of a window exit, and if occupied by passengers shout!

If the window exit is adjacent to a bulkhead, position yourself against the bulkhead or up on a seat, or if you are too tall
position yourself either 1 row forward or aft of the window exit. Brace yourself against the back of the seat or wall of the
fuselage and assess which side of the a/c is above water and safe to open. For the exit that is below water shout the
following to an ABP:

For the exit that is above the water, while pointing to the serviceable exit shout the following:

638 / 845

Once the exit is open and serviceable, shout the following to get the pax out of their seats and moving toward the window
exit:

To direct pax out of the exit shout the following:

639 / 845

Continue shouting SIT! JUMP! SWIM AWAY AND HUDDLE! until all pax have evacuated or exit becomes blocked.
NOTE: It is important to the get the pax as far away from the a/c to prevent any pax from being pulled under with
the undertow of the a/c when it begins to sink.

640 / 845

10.1.28 METHOD OF EVACUATING OUT OF EXITS
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

The method of evacuating out of the exits may change due to the different types of exits, location, size, equipment at the
exit and the a/c attitude when it comes to rest.

EXIT
MPD

METHOD OF EXITING

Go down as quickly and safely as possible
and move away from the a/c.

REAR STARBOARD DOOR EXIT
R3 DHC-7

Jump or sit and jump, then move away from
the a/c.

WINDOW EXITS
R1 on DHC-8

Jump or sit and jump, then move away from
the a/c.

R1, R2 & L1
F/D ESCAPE WINDOWS DHC-7
Pull down on escape rope;

Ensure escape rope is securely anchored to
the a/c and let it hang outside of the window;

Step up on the seat;

Sit on the window edge with legs outside the
a/c;

Holding onto the rope, turn yourself around
and lower yourself to the ground using the
hand over hand method; and

Once on the ground move away from the a/c.

641 / 845

F/D ESCAPE HATCH DHC-8
Move operating handle 72 degrees counterclockwise
The hatch will fall inward
Remove rope compartment cover, left side of
escape hatch
Pull rope from recess
Ensure that rope is attached to aircraft by
tugging on it
Throw rope out of exit
Climb out of the exit onto the fuselage
Using the escape rope, lower yourself to the
ground

NOTE: The F/D emergency exits would only be used by F/A’s and Pax’s as A LAST RESORT when there are no
other exits available. This is due to the fact that Flight Deck emergency exits are significantly more difficult to
exit out of and are not always accessible because of the F/D Door Locking procedures.

642 / 845

10.1.29 EVACUATION FLOW
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

In an evacuation as each pax arrives at the exit the F/A will shout instructions (SHOUT COMMANDS) to the pax’s. If the
pax hesitates, place one hand on the pax’s shoulder and push firmly with the other hand on the pax’s backside.
To maintain a steady flow of pax’s, push those who hesitate to exit. If congestion occurs, redirect pax’s to another exit.
In order to expedite an evacuation, incapacitated pax’s will be evacuated last.
When there is a need for redirecting pax’s to another exit, you may attempt to stand on a seat to assess the
cabin (SEAR). Caution must be taken if the incident is caused by a fire.
If the evacuation flow begins to slow, you will need to speed things up! Use the following commands:

Non-ambulatory pax’s who require assistance should be evacuated after the initial evacuation flow, in order to avoid
being pushed or injured by others.
Once the flow of pax’s to your exit begins to diminish, and it is safe to do so, you will check the cabin for remaining
pax’s. Using the emergency flashlight, you will go up and down each bank of seats and the sidewalls and shout the
following:

Flight attendants should do everything possible to evacuate everyone, but are not obligated to risk their own lives in
doing so. The remaining pax’s will require direction and assistance once outside of the a/c. You are no good to anyone if
you are injured or worse yet, dead because you chose to jeopardize your own safety and life.

643 / 845

10.1.30 POST EVACUATION
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

Post evacuation and crash procedures are important to increase the survivability of crew and passengers in each type of
incident.
To help simplify the procedures, we group these into 2 main categories:
At an airport
Off / away from an airport.

In all situations F/A’s are required to remove the following emergency equipment for all land evacuations:

2 F/A’S CREWED

EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT TO TAKE
FOR LAND EVAC

ICFA

Emergency flashlight and megaphone (post
evacuation and direction).

#2 F/A

Emergency flashlight and first aid kit
1 F/A CREWED

10.1.31 POST EVACUATION PROCEDURES WHEN AT AN AIRPORT
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

The procedures are as follows:
1. Group passengers together 300 feet away and upwind from the a/c
2. Head count; (to confirm all souls on board have been evacuated)
3. Administer first aid
4. Ensure pax’s are handed over to the proper authorities. (i.e.: RCMP, ambulance personnel, airport manager and
company personnel).

645 / 845

10.1.32 POST EVACUATION PROCEDURES WHEN AWAY FROM AN AIPORT
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

The procedures are as follows:
1. Group passengers together 300 feet away and upwind from the a/c
2. Head count; (to confirm all souls on board have been evacuated)
3. Administer first aid
4. Signals
5. Shelter
6. Sustenance.

SIGNALS:
1. The ELT is activated with a “5 G” force, or if necessary manually. Other signaling devices may be retrieved from the
survival gear that is carried o/b the a/c.
2. Allocate the use of a location mirror to a crew member.
3. Build 3 signal fires at least 30 m (100 feet) apart. 3 fires or signals placed in groups of 3 are International distress
calls.
4. Build fires in open area and grouped in a triangle pattern.
5. Put anything in a bright color (preferably orange) in a 3 dot triangle.
6. Use rubber or oil from the crashed aircraft to make good black smoke that can be easily seen from a distance.
7. Activate flares in good visibility once another aircraft is seen or heard.
8. Leave markers if embarking from the crash site.

(pics)
SHELTER
Protection from the elements takes top priority. Guard against hypothermia by keeping warm.
1. Seek any natural shelter that the surrounding terrain might offer and erect some kind of windbreak, preferably one
that will also provide protection from rain.

646 / 845

2. If the aircraft is stabilized and deemed safe, it may provide adequate shelter.
3. If the aircraft is not useable, it may be necessary to dig shelters in the snow or use tree branches and debris to
construct adequate protection from the elements.
4. Use whatever materials are at hand. Make use of any aircraft parts.
5. Maintain body heat by using the thermal survival blankets and whatever extra clothing you have. Huddle together if
necessary.
6. You may need to provide survival first aid.

SUSTENANCE
1. Assign ABP’s to search for water and food.
2. The survival kit, if retrievable will be valuable to surviving.
3. Preferably the recovery of on board supplies and commissary would enhance survivability.
4. Contents of personal baggage that is still usable.

IMPORTANT FACTORS IN SUCCESSFUL GROUP SURVIVAL
1. Organization of manpower
2. Selective use of personnel
3. Acceptance of suggestions or criticism
4. Consideration of available time
5. Checking equipment
6. Surveying the situation
7. Survival knowledge and skills and the will to survive
8. Reaction speed.

10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

Although F/A’s have the primary responsibility for pax evacuation, able-bodied persons may be selected to
assist depending on the type of assistance required and the time available.
An Able Bodied Person / ABP is a person or persons that can be assigned to assist in emergency procedures. It
is advised that when choosing this person that he / she is willing, ready and able to carry out your instructions.
ABP’s are used in the following situations:
To assist disabled pax and minors
To open unmanned exits or possibly your exit in the event you are injured & unable to open it
For crowd control.

In selecting ABP’s, F/A’s should not recruit the assistance of pax’s who have family members with them or those whom
have been drinking. Select the following to be ABP’s:
Company flight personnel / employees
Other airline employees
Law enforcement / military personnel
Fire fighters
Security personnel
Volunteers.

Potential ABP’s should be approached and asked if they would assist. Say the following:

The ABP solicited for assistance can decline to help. Should they say no, move on to the next possible ABP.
It is recommended that when time permits, the F/A’s should brief a minimum of 2 ABP’s per unmanned exits (1 to block
and 1 to open) .
In some cases you may have to relocate the ABP closer to or at an exit. If relocation is necessary, brief ABP on new
brace position as applicable.
The briefing should consist of the following:

648 / 845

1. Upon consent of YES they will help, F/A reseat ABP to exit and review brace position (if applicable)
2. When not to open:(If they hear a command to remain seated or 3 chimes)
3. When to open exits:(when they hear evacuate, evacuate or multiple chimes or release belts get out)
4. How to assess:(look outside first for fire, high water or any type of hazard that could cause injury)
5. How to block and how to redirect if unsafe / unusable
6. If safe, how to open
7. How to evacuate
8. How to assist outside of exit: (ABP’s will be first one’s out of the a/c)
9. Have ABP repeat instructions back to you: (say to ABP “ tell me what you are going to do”)
10. Hand them SFC and have ABP review Safety Features Card.

10.1.38 ABP’s AS BUDDIES
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

F/A’s will set up a “buddy system” to assist any pax requiring assistance.
It is important to avoid breaking up family units and ensure you pair children with adults.
Ensure each family member knows with whom they are paired.
Seat buddies next to those they are to help.
Inform them that they will be assisting with the safety and evacuation of the assigned pax.
If the person they are helping has special needs, brief according to the individual needs of the SPAT and ask the
ABP Buddy to wait for the flow of traffic to diminish before assisting this special needs person to evacuate.

10.1.39 BRACE POSITIONS // GENERAL
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

The brace position is the pre-positioning assumed in order to protect the human body during impact.
Most research and investigations have shown that people tend to survive most impact situations if they are prepared
and braced for it.
In being braced, the body is in the least vulnerable position to absorb the impact (s) as opposed to reacting from impact.
There are two primary reasons for bracing for impact:
To reduce flailing of the body
To reduce injury caused by secondary impact(s).

656 / 845

10.1.40 CHILDREN BRACE POSITIONS
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

Generally, children occupying pax seats should adopt the same brace positions as adults. Because of their smaller
stature, the flail envelope of YCH is smaller than that of adults.
The safety belt should be placed low on the child’s torso just above the legs at the hips. If the belt cannot be adjusted so
that it is tight on a small YCH, the YCH may sit on a pillow or blanket in order to raise the child so that the safety belt
will fit securely. The pillow should not be placed behind the YCH.

657 / 845

10.1.41 FORWARD FACING ADULT BRACE POSITION (high density seating)
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

This brace position is suitable in an a/c with high density seating, or where due to space limitations or physical
limitations passengers are unable to place their head on their lap (i.e. pregnant)
1. Sit well back in center of the seat.
2. Place feet flat on the floor, slightly ahead of seat.
3. Fasten seatbelt low and tight.
4. Bend forward as far as possible.
5. Grasp the top of the seatback in front of you.
6. As long as hands and / or arms support the head, their exact placement is not important.
7. Rest your forehead onto your arms and get as low as possible.
8. If resting against a seat back with a “break-over feature”, do not hold the edge of the seat back with fingers.
9. Pregnant women should be instructed to place the safety belt low, below the abdomen, so that it applies its forces to
the pelvis.

658 / 845

10.1.42 FORWARD FACING ADULT BRACE POSITION (low density seating)
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

This brace position is suitable for passengers occupying forward facing seats where seats are placed relatively far
apart (i.e exit row seats).
1. Sit well back in center of the seat.
2. Place feet flat on the floor, slightly ahead of seat.
3. Fasten seatbelt low and tight.
4. Bend forward and fold arms under knees or grasp ankles.
5. Head (face down) and chest down in lap.

NOTE: As previously indicated children are braced in the same manner, but have padding such as pillows or
blankets placed under buttocks to ensure a tight fitting seatbelt. Children will bend forward over the safety belt
and rest their head on the seat cushion between their legs or bend their head forward over the edge of the
cushion, as appropriate for their height.

659 / 845

10.1.43 AFT FACING SEATS EQUIPPED WITH SAFETY BELT BRACE POSITION DHC-7

10.1.45 FLIGHT ATTENDANT BRACE POSITIONS
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

Flight Attendant Stations require a shoulder harness as well as a lap belt. It is the F/A’s responsibility to ensure their
assigned seat and station is all in good working order during the PFSC. The webbing of a safety belt and harness should
lie flat against the body and should not be twisted or frayed. They must be adjusted to fit properly prior to boarding the
pax. F/A’s will assume the indicated brace position for each take-off and landing.

10.1.47 SPECIFIC EMERGENCY PROCEDURES // GENERAL
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

The following content pertains to different types of emergencies including “potential” emergencies that a flight attendant
could encounter.

664 / 845

10.1.48 INCAPACITATED FLIGHT CREW MEMBER
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

The pilots seats are designed to be easily moved provided two conditions are met. There must be someone in the seat
and the seat back should be vertical to distribute the body weight evenly.
In the event that one of the F/D crew members becomes incapacitated the other pilot will summon the ICFA to the Flight
Deck.
STEP ONE // REMOVE & RESTRAIN
Using the seat controls:
1. Move the seat to the furthest aft position (this may require the assistance of the other pilot, F/A or ABP).
2. Position the seat fully down.
3. Fasten the safety harness and ensure they are tight and locked.
4. Cross the arms and tuck arms & hands beneath the shoulder harness to prevent interference from flailing arms.
5. Once the seat is in the appropriate position you will be better able to provide the necessary first aid attention.

STEP TWO // ADMINISTER FIRST AID
1. Loosen the collar and tie ensuring the head has not fallen too far back, which could put undue pressure on the
windpipe.
2. Administer first aid and oxygen as required.
3. Follow any instruction from the other pilot.

665 / 845

10.1.49 REMOVAL OF INCAPACIATED FLIGHT CREW MEMBER FROM F/D
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

Should the other pilot deem it necessary that the incapacitated pilot be removed from their seat, follow their instructions
and proceed with the following steps:
1. Find another crew member or ABP to assist as this procedure must be done very carefully.
2. Raise the armrests.
3. Lower the seat to the lowest setting by using the levers on the base of the seat.
4. Release the harness.
5. One person places their arms under the pilots armpits and grasp wrists.
6. The other person grasp the pilots ankles to prevent the feet from touching any controls.
7. At the same time carefully pull the pilot UP, AFT and OUT.
8. Carry the pilot out of the F/D.
9. Administer first aid, CPR or Oxygen as required.
10. Secure into a pax seat for severe turbulence and or landing.

NOTE: Due to the confined space and difficulty in removing an incapacitated pilot, this procedure is deemed as a
last resort.

666 / 845

10.1.50 INCAPACITATED FLIGHT ATTENDANT 1 F/A ON DUTY
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

The incapacitated ICFA or an ABP will alert the F/D
The F/O will:
1. Attend to the F/A and administer first aid required
2. Make all pax announcements
3. Ensure cabin is secure for landing.

667 / 845

10.1.51 If there is a DECLARED EMERGENCY and the only F/A on duty is inc
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

1. The F/O will assign an ABP to the # 1 jump seat
2. Brief the ABP on seat and equipment operation
3. Brief on exit operation, signals for brace and evacuation.

668 / 845

10.1.52 INCAPACITATED FLIGHT ATTENDANT 2 F/A’S ON DUTY
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

The F/D will be informed and the remaining F/A will:
1. Attend to the F/A and administer first aid
2. Assume all F/A responsibilities
3. Select the #1 jump seat as the primary station.

In either situation, the a/c will be landed at the first suitable location with medical facility (if required).

669 / 845

10.1.53 GATE // RAMP & TAXI EMERGENCIES
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

These emergency situations can occur while the aircraft is parked at:
A loading bridge
On the ramp
Stopped on the taxiway or ramp.

PROCEDURES
1. Close liaison shall be maintained between the F/D and the cabin. This will normally be the responsibility of the PIC
and the ICFA.
2. If the air crew members are not on board, the ICFA will assume command.
3. The severity of the situation will govern the procedures to follow.
4. If time and circumstances permit, have the passengers rapid deplane.
5. If the situation is critical, have the passengers evacuate.
6. In any case, direct pax to a safe distance and area away from the a/c.
7. Assist pax as much as possible until relieved by ground personnel or until your help is no longer required.

(Reference Chapter 2 for Fueling Emergencies)

670 / 845

10.1.54 ABNORMALITY DURING TAXI // TAKE-OFF OR LANDING
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

In the event of any abnormality affecting safety during taxi, take-off or landing, the a/c will be stopped immediately and if
hazardous conditions are present, the engines will be shut down and evacuation effected.
If no smoke, fire, fuel leak or other hazards are apparent, the a/c may be taxied clear of the runway.

671 / 845

10.1.55 ENGINE TORCHING
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

Torching occurs when raw fuel fumes enter the engine cell during fueling. This fuel may ignite during normal start up
procedures. When this happens it may exhaust a long streak of flame and smoke out the back of the engine upon startup. This is spectacular to watch but is not normally an emergency situation. This will be harder to see as the wings and
engines are high on the fuselage.
If a stream of vapor smoke and or continuous flame is escaping that lasts more than 5 seconds:
Report the occurrence to the PIC immediately
No action should be taken to evacuate the pax unless directed to do so by the PIC but ensure you keep the pax
calm.

672 / 845

10.1.56 ENGINE FIRES
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

Not to be confused with torching, engine fires can be caused by an internal engine failure and are normally monitored and
controlled by the F/D with a warning and extinguishing system.
These fires can be seen more easily at night and can be identified immediately. Normally the fire will be outside the
engine nacelle and could result in explosions.
The PIC will advise if there is a need for a rapid deplane or an evacuation.

673 / 845

10.1.57 PROPELLER OVERSPEED and RUNAWAY PROPELLER
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

A runaway propeller is one that is overspeeding and may not be able to be controlled by the pilots. This may be
recognized by a sudden increase in noise to a high pitch or whine, sudden sideways swerve of the a/c, change in altitude
and attitude, and possible reduction of power in one engine, with an increase in the other.
There is a danger of one of the blades separating and breaking through the fuselage. The following procedures apply:
Ensure all pax remain seated with seatbelts fastened.
Do not relocate any pax unless advised to do so by the PIC.
If instructed to relocate pax from the vicinity of the propeller, avoid mass movement!

674 / 845

10.1.58 REJECTED / ABORTED TAKE-OFF
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

A rejected / aborted take-off occurs when a flight is prepared for take-off and the PIC decides not to complete the take-off
and stops the aircraft. This can happen anytime during the procedure from stopping during a turn onto the runway to
stopping during a full take-off roll.
F/A’s would recognize the take-off as rejected / aborted by noticing a very sudden drop in power plus maximum breaking
from high speed, depending on the circumstances.
Normally this would not be an emergency and the F/A would not initiate an evacuation.
As soon as possible the PIC will make an announcement informing the pax and cabin crew why the take-off was
rejected / aborted.
The F/A’s will remain secured in their seats awaiting instructions from the PIC and maintaining situational
awareness.

Should the F/A suddenly assess that an emergency situation is developing:
Contact the F/D
State the nature of the problem.
Determine need to rapid deplane or evacuate.

675 / 845

10.1.59 MISSED APPROACH
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

A missed approach occurs when the a/c is in descent for landing, and the PIC is unable to complete the approach and
landing and therefore powers up the a/c and ascends again.
The F/A would recognize the landing as a missed approach
Normally, this would not be an emergency situation. The F/A would remain secured in seat until the a/c has levelled
off, and wait for instructions from the PIC.

676 / 845

10.1.60 PRESSURIZATION
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

In a/c operating at high altitudes, the required amount of oxygen is normally provided by pressurizing the cabin.
Pressurization is accomplished by regulating the outflow of bleed air which is provided by the aircraft engines. Outside air
is compressed so that it is of the same density and oxygen percentage per cubic inch as that of a pre-selected altitude air
density. This compressed air is then circulated throughout the cabin. This allows the a/c to fly at higher altitudes without
fear of Hypoxia affecting crew and pax. As long as the air pressure in the cabin is maintained, pax and flight personnel
will function normally, as they are receiving an adequate supply of oxygen. Pressurization is monitored by the pilots.
(Reference Chapter 6 entitled Hypoxia)

677 / 845

10.1.61 DEPRESSURIZATION
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

Normally all flights are operated so that the pressure inside the cabin (cabin altitude) will never exceed the pressure
encountered at an outside altitude of 9,000 feet. If when flying at higher altitudes the pressure in the cabin decreases, a
decompression situation exists.
The type and severity of a depressurization can vary depending upon:
Total cabin volume
Size of the hole in the pressure hull
Pressure differential
The flight altitude.

678 / 845

10.1.62 TYPES OF DEPRESSURIZATION
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

There are two ways that an a/c can lose its pressurization:
By failure of the pressurizing system = Depressurization
By structural failure = Decompression.

The loss of pressure can take from a fraction of a second to many minutes.

679 / 845

10.1.63 CATEGORIES OF DECOMPRESSIONS
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

Decompressions can be further recognized in two categories:
Slow decompression
Rapid decompression.

The only difference between them is the time it takes the cabin to decompress. The time required for equalization of cabin
and external pressures during a decompression depends primarily upon the size of the hole or leak in the pressure hull.
A leaking door seal may be classed as a slow decompression, where as a rupture in the a/c wall would be considered as
a rapid decompression.

680 / 845

10.1.64 SLOW DECOMPRESSION // PRESSURE LEAK
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

A leaking door seal or window may be identified by:
a high pitched whistling noise and or a flow of air through the leak (a loud hissing noise)
The leak could have localized cooling.

Physical signs may include:
Ear popping or sinus discomfort
Pain
Symptoms of hypoxia.

Should F/A’s suspect a pressure leak, or pax or F/A’s are experiencing problems i.e. ear, sinus discomfort:
1. Notify the PIC immediately

If conditions warrant and on instruction from the PIC:
2. The appropriate PA announcement will be made
3. Fasten seatbelt and No smoking ordinance signs will be turned on
4. F/A to ensure that pax keep seatbelts fastened and refrain from smoking
5. Do not touch the leaking exit or window
6. Where possible, move adjacent pax away from suspected leak
7. Limit activity
8. Monitor pax and other crew
9. Avoid the area as much as possible
10. Administer oxygen as required
11. Follow the PIC’s instructions – You may need to prepare the cabin for a “possible’ emergency descent.

681 / 845

(Reference Chapter 6 entitled Effective Performance Time & Time of Useful Consciousness Definitions).

682 / 845

10.1.65 RAPID DECOMPRESSION
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

A rapid or explosive decompression is normally accompanied by the following:
A loud noise or bang
A sudden rush of air into the cabin
Rapid drop in temperature
Fogging and clouding in the cabin (due to warm cabin air mixing with the colder outside air)
Loose objects in the area may be suctioned out of the opening during this sudden rush of air.

Physical symptoms will include:
Rapid chest expansion
Air may be sucked out of lungs, lips and cheeks may flutter
Temporary pain in the ears and sinuses
Abdominal pain due to intestinal gas expansion
Loss of consciousness.

683 / 845

10.1.66 RAPID DECOMPRESSION // PILOT ACTION
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

1. Don oxygen masks
2. Emergency descent
3. A/C will assume a nose down attitude
4. Once stabilized at a safe and breathable altitude (approx. 13,000 feet or lower) the PIC will announce over the PA
“Ladies and Gentlemen, we have experienced pressurization difficulties. We have leveled off at a comfortable
altitude. Please follow the F/A’s instructions. ICFA to the flight deck”.
5. Prepare and plan to land at the nearest suitable airport.
6. Advise the ICFA as situation progresses.

684 / 845

10.1.67 RAPID // DECOMPRESSION // F/A ACTION
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

1. Immediately sit down and fasten seatbelt (if in a pax seat) or jumpseat harness (if in a F/A jumpseat).
2. If an empty seat is not available, sit on the floor and hang on.
3. You can attempt to shout to the pax to Fasten Seatbelts (but not if it is too difficult to breathe).
4. Upon hearing “ICFA to the flight deck” (signal that the a/c has reached a breathable altitude),obtain the nearest
oxygen and take 3 good breaths of oxygen.
5. Assess the pax condition and provide supplemental oxygen to pax who require assistance (If under a time constraint
to receive TESTS briefing, admin O2 & secure the bottle after the TESTS briefing).

6. Turn off buffet / galley electrical power as urns may boil over.
7. Assess any structural damage.
8. The F/A nearest to the lavatory should determine if anyone is in it and in need of assistance.
9. ICFA report to the F/D with EP Card, pen and TESTS form and give a situation report on the cabin. Report to include
general pax condition and any structural damage.

10.1.70 FIRES // GENERAL
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

A fire inflight is one of the most life threatening occurrences possible. Cabin fires and associated smoke are a serious
threat to all aircraft. They are unpredictable and have the potential to develop rapidly into unmanageable proportions.
Most cabin interior materials are smoke generating and produce toxic by-products. The smoke and fumes can reach the
F/D rapidly and the consequences of crew incapacitation are fatal. The prospect of pax panic is a real hazard and must
be controlled.
Electrical fires require specific crew coordination as the source of the fire may be difficult to ascertain, hence requiring
assistance. Prior to fighting an electrical fire, power to that area must be cut off.
There is a grave concern when required to fight a fire when there is only 1 F/A o/b. Communications and coordination are
critical. Should you be alone, you will need to advise an ABP whenever you must leave the cabin. For example, tell them
you are going to the F/D and will be back in 2 minutes.
The same type of communication will be essential with the air crew. For example, in your first call tell them you will be
calling back in 2 minutes, this will ensure that the F/D is aware of your presence, or the lack of it.
Of particular importance is TIME. The time over which a fire develops to a detectable level and then the time over which
the fire remains potentially extinguishable are critical. If fires are not to develop, vigilance is essential. A coordinated effort
by all crewmembers is required to fight a fire and with only a limited amount of fire extinguishers o/b the a/c, it is important
to maximize their use.

688 / 845

10.1.71 FIRE CHEMISTRY
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

Fire is a product of combustion. Combustion consists of three (3) elements:
1. Heat

2. Oxygen

3. Fuel.

Together, these elements create a chain reaction and result in a fire. The goal when fighting a fire is to
eliminate one of these elements, thereby breaking the combustion chain.
A fire will continue unless:

1.The fuel supply has been cut off

2. There is no more oxygen available

3. The temperature has been cooled below the flammability temperature

689 / 845

10.1.72 FIRE CLASSIFICATION
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

There are four (4) different classes of fires and they are determined by the type of fuel feeding the fire:

CLASS A = Ordinary Combustible Material (think A for ashes) such as:
Paper, Wood, Cloth, Plastics and Rubbish.
Class A fires need to be cooled. Use Halon 1211 first & cool with water, coffee, tea or juice. Never use alcohol.

SMOKE:
Usually gray / brown color & can be quite thick depending on the quantity of fuel.

CLASS B =Flammable Liquids (think B for booze) such as:
Hydraulic fluid, oil, tar or aircraft fuel.
For Class B fires use Halon 1211.

SMOKE:
Usually black in color. Very thick, with a distinct oil / petrol –like odor.

CLASS C = Electrical (think C for circuits) such as:
Buffet / galley equipment, Flight deck instruments, Motors and generators.

690 / 845

For Class C fires pull breakers and then use Halon 1211

SMOKE:
Usually light grey or white, with a bluish tinge. Very fine and can disperse rapidly. Has a distinct acrid odor.

CLASS D = Flammable Metal (think D for dagger) such as:
Aircraft structure, sodium, magnesium, lithium and potassium.

691 / 845

10.1.73 FLASHFIRE DESCRIPTION
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

A flashfire occurs when combustible gases accumulate at ceiling level (gases emitted from burning materials). If the
gases reach a flammable temperature with the fire present, a flashfire (explosion) will occur.

692 / 845

10.1.74 FLASHOVER DESCRIPTION
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

A flashover occurs when the ceiling and upper walls of the a/c become very hot due to heat generated by a fire. This heat
is radiated back down and heats the contents of the fire area. When ignition point is reached, a flashover occurs.
Investigations have shown that flashover can occur shortly after the exits are opened due to the influx of large amounts of
oxygen. Therefore when evacuation is initiated it is imperative that evacuation be completed ASAP!

693 / 845

10.1.75 DETECTION and FIRE PREVENTION
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

The a/c itself does have several built in fire protection components. The engines have systems to indicate to the crew that
smoke, extreme heat or fire may be present. In the passenger cabin, all cabin attendant and passenger seats are fire
retardant, lavatories and cargo areas are equipped with smoke detectors and there is an automatic potty bottle (small
Halon 1211) in the waste bin of the lav. Buffet / Galley and toilet waste bins are designed to contain a fire.
However, even with prevention, cabin fires can still occur. It cannot be emphasized enough about the importance of
preventing a fire on board an aircraft in the first place. Consider it your first and best defense.
As F/A’s you are responsible to follow safe practices continuously which includes thorough PFSC’s and monitoring of
the pax, cabin and lavatory on a frequent basis. You want to monitor the pax actions in an effort to eliminate their creating
“potential” fire situations. Such practices will also serve to assist in the early detection of a fire hazard situation. Frequent
checks are to be conducted by F/A’s during each flight.
Fire may not always be obvious and smoke and flames may not always be visible. There may be other indications that a
potential fire is in progress. Possible indications of fire are:
Fumes or unusual odors
Electrical malfunctions such as circuit breakers “popping”
Noises such as popping, snapping or crackling, which may indicate electrical arcing
Hot spots on sidewalls, floors and panels.

Specific checks are to be made frequently during each flight for the following:
Continue to enforce No Smoking regulations on the ramp during boarding or deplaning and in the cabin during flight
Smoke detectors are located in all lavatories, continually monitor area for adherence to the No Smoking regulations
Check floor areas and up side walls to ensure they are kept free of clothing, bags, paper
Check to make sure no paper products are over, in or underneath electrical equipment.

Fire prevention is simple and can easily be incorporated into the F/A’s normal duties.
Only use equipment in the manner that it was intended
Report any electrical problems that occur during flight to the PIC. DO NOT ASSUME that it fixed itself
Follow circuit breaker policy. Get the PIC’s permission to reset – but ONLY RESET if the equipment is ESSENTIAL
to the SAFE OPERATION of the flight

694 / 845

Snag and shut off electrical supply to any malfunctioning equipment (coordinated with PIC)
Always maintain Situational Awareness and be ALERT for fumes and or smoke, and INVESTIGATE IMMEDIATELY
Should the lavatory detector sound investigate immediately and take action as required
Always ensure the oxygen bottles @ row 7 are equipped with the protective heat shield
After combatting any fire MONITOR it for recurrence.

695 / 845

10.1.76 CIRCUIT BREAKERS
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

All a/c are fitted with a system of circuit breakers as a precaution against electrical fires. This is a device designed to open
or trip an electrical current when the current exceeds the safe limit.
A popped circuit breaker can indicate a potential problem with the electrical circuit being protected. The practice of
attempting one reset should only be considered if the equipment is considered essential to the continued safety of the
flight. Depending on the amperage of the breaker and its location within the circuit being protected, resetting a popped
breaker may create a more adverse situation than simply leaving the breaker out.
Crews are cautioned of the inherent danger in:
1. Pulling breakers o/b a/c in order to silence an alerting or warning device that may give a valid alarm
2. Indiscriminately resetting popped circuit breakers.

696 / 845

10.1.77 SHOULD A BREAKER TRIP OR BE PULLED DUE TO A FIRE
10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

1. F/A’s must advise the PIC and get permission to reset and only reset if essential for the continued safety of the
flight.
2. Wait for a short cooling period (approximately 2-3 minutes) before resetting.
3. Reset by pushing in so that the white band is no longer visible, but never hold the breaker in the reset position.
4. A circuit breaker may only be reset once.
5. If the breaker trips again or if unsure, advise the PIC and ICFA who will record it in the Journey Log Book and Cabin
Log Book.

10. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
10.1 Emergency Procedures

In a time available emergency landing, your planned emergency procedures card (EP card) will serve as a checklist of
duties in order of priority.
The checklist was developed from a no time available, to plenty of time available and should be carried out as prescribed
on the card.
It is also designed for operation with 2 flight attendants to ensure clear distribution of tasks required. However, it should
be obvious that when only 1 F/A is crewed, the 1 F/A is responsible to ensure all actions on the checklist / card are
completed.
Your EP Card must be easily accessible and readily available for immediate use at all times during flight.
For ease of review and reference in the FAM, each individual section of the EP Card is indicated on a separate
page.
A portable copy is what you will be using when on board the aircraft for an actual emergency.
The EP Card includes procedures for both land and water emergency landings. All water procedures are indicated
by blue ink.
The TEST Forms are located behind Tab 14 and the EP Card is located behind Tab 15.
Where the card indicates BOTH F/A’s, ensure you complete the required task for your designated zones as

11.1.5 ABOUT THE CANADIAN AVIATION REGULATIONS (CARs)
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

(Reference Chapter 1 for the list of applicable CARs)
In 1996 Transport Canada concluded a total revision of the aviation safety regulations. The revision incorporates
recommendations made by the Moshansky Commission, the 1992 / 93 Federal Regulatory Review, the TCA Rules
Harmonization Project, and the Transportation Safety Board.
The new regulations are entitled the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs) and are more complete and easier to
understand than the old regulations, while maintaining or enhancing safety. Developed in consultation with the aviation
community as part of the Canadian Aviation Regulation Advisory Council (or CARAC) process, the new regulations
exemplify the benefits of the partnership approach.
The CARs were published in Part I of the Canada Gazette in the fall of 1995. As a result of the many comments received,
significant changes were made prior to their publication in Part II of the Canada Gazette on October 2, 1996. The new
regulations came into force on October 10, 1996, with a 60 day implementation period being granted to permit
commercial air operators, private operators, Flight Training Units, and Aircraft Maintenance Organizations to achieve full
compliance. Improvement of the CARs continues to be an important facet of the Civil Aviation safety program.

11.1.6 WHAT IS THE AERONAUTICS ACT?
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

The Aeronautics Act (Act) is an act of Parliament providing the basis for the regulation of aeronautics. The Act empowers
the Governor in Council (Special Committee of the Cabinet) to make regulations to carry out the Minister’s mandate. It is
an act to authorize the control of aeronautics.

738 / 845

11.1.7 WHAT IS CARAC?
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

The Canadian Aviation Regulation Advisory Council (CARAC) has been a part of the Civil Aviation rulemaking process
since 1993. Its prime objective is to assess and recommend potential regulatory changes through cooperative rulemaking
activities. Much work has been done during this time, with CARAC being identified by central agencies as a best practice
with respect to openness and transparency.
CARAC is a joint undertaking of government and the aviation community, with participation from a large number of
organizations outside Transport Canada representing the overall viewpoint of the aviation community. These include
management and labour organization, representing operators and manufacturers, and professional associations.

739 / 845

11.1.8 WHAT ARE THE CARS?
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

CARs are the result of the consolidation of the Air Regulations and Air Navigation Orders into a comprehensive eight-part
publication. This Transport Canada Civil Aviation initiative revised and updated existing regulations and standards in
order to produce a more accessible, clear and logical set of regulatory documents.

740 / 845

11.1.9 WHAT ARE REGULATIONS?
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

Regulations are rules of conduct made by the Cabinet on advice of the Minister of Transport or by the Minister him or
herself. In the legal sense, the Air Regulations, Air Regulations Series (which began to be published in the mid 1980’s to
replace the Air Regulations and Air Navigation Orders) and Air Navigation Orders (ANO’s) are considered “regulations”
in that they are all rules of conduct prescribing or directing action or forbearance. The making, amending and repealing of
“regulations” must follow certain legal requirements as set out in the Statutory Instruments Act.

741 / 845

11.1.10 WHAT ARE STANDARDS DOCUMENTS?
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

Many of the regulatory provisions made under the Act incorporate “standards” publications by reference. There are two
principal types of standards: those which set out criteria and conditions to be met for the issuance and maintenance of a
Canadian aviation document; and those which set out the “how – to” of complying with a specific rule of conduct.
Standards may be contained in a Transport Canada Aviation (TCA) publication, publications of other federal agencies
and publications produced outside of the federal government (such as Annex 2 of ICAO – Document 7030 and the FARs).
Furthermore, standards may be incorporated at a fixed date or amended from time to time.
Unlike “regulations”, the making and amendment of standards documents is a flexible process not subject to the legal
requirements set out in the Statutory Instruments Act.
Some publications which contain standards also contain material such as recommended practices and advisory notes
which do not have the force of the law. These publications should clearly differentiate which provisions are mandatory
and which are not.

742 / 845

11.1.11 HOW ARE THE CARs ORGANIZED?
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE

11.1.12 THE CARs NUMBERING SYSTEM
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

The numbering scheme for the Regulations, Standards and Advisories is similar in many respects. The diagram on the
next page illustrates what each digit represents. Pay close attention to the second digit as it indicates what document type
you are looking at.
The first digit “7” identifies to which Part of the Canadian Aviation Regulations this section refers. This example is
showing the regulation 705.20 will be found in Part VII (Commercial Air Services).
The second digit “0” refers to the applicable publication and may vary as follows:
705.20 = is the regulation imposing the requirements for an Operational Control System and is found in the Canadian
Aviation Regulations;
725.20 = is the corresponding section of the Commercial Air Service Standards (CASS) where the various options for
Operational Control System are described;
745.20 = is the corresponding section of the guidance material found various aspects of the Operational Control
System, such as approval procedures, inspection; etc.
The third digit identifies the subpart of the Canadian Aviation Regulations to which this section refers. The example
shows that regulation 705.20 will be found in subpart 5 of Part VII (Airline Operations).
The two or three digits right of the dot is a unique number attributed to each individual section. Number “20”, when used
in 705 / 725 / 745 / 765 deals with Operational Control System throughout publications.
The numbering schemes are further broken down into subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs and clause.

744 / 845

11.1.13 GUIDANCE MATERIAL NUMBERING SYSTEM
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

Guidance material may provide explanations on either publication, the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs – 705
numbers) or the Commercial Air Service Standards (CASS 725 numbers).
For ease of reference, guidance material is numbered as follows:
Numbers preceded by the letter “R” provide explanation to the section of the CARs (e.g. R745.20 provides
explanation on CAR 705.20).
Numbers preceded by the letter “S” provide explanation to a section of the CASS (e.g. S745.20 provides
explanation on CASS 725.20).
Numbers preceded by both letters, “R” and “S”, provide explanation to both, CARs and CASS (e.g. RS745.20
provides explanation on both CAR 705.20 and CASS 725.20).

11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

This section is to clarify the differences between Personal Audio Headsets, Personal Noise Filtering headsets and
Protective Hearing Appliances worn for medical reasons or protective purposes.
(pics)

746 / 845

11.1.15 PERSONAL AUDIO HEADSETS
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

Personal Audio Headsets are those that are used with personal entertainment systems such as IPOD’s, MP3’s etc.
Some of these devices can filter out as much as 85% of ambient noise. There are serious potential hazards associated
with pax use of personal headsets during boarding, deplaning, taxi, take-off, descent and landing, and they are NOT
permitted to be used during these times.

747 / 845

11.1.16 PERSONAL NOISE FILTERING HEADSETS
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

Noise filtering headsets are devices capable of creating an “anti-noise” wave that has the ability to cancel out the
unwanted sound of certain frequencies.
These types of headsets are often capable of connecting to an aircraft IFE system or a passengers own personal PED.
While these devices do permit the user to hear sounds around them, if the device is equipped with charging or audio
cables, a passenger using these devices during taxi, take-off, or landing could create an obstruction during an emergency
landing and they are NOT permitted to be used during these times.

748 / 845

11.1.17 PROTECTIVE HEARING APPLIANCES
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

Passengers with sensitivity to noise or who have hearing disorders such as hyperacusis may be required to wear
protective hearing devices to mitigate discomfort or pain.
These devices may consist of ear plugs, headsets (with or without cords) ear caps or ear molds. These devices do not
generally impede the user from hearing sound as they are intended to filter out low frequency noise such as is found on
board an a/c.
The TCCA Medicine Branch has advised that while each person may be different, a passenger wearing these devices will
likely be able to hear safety announcements and emergency commands while using them.
The use of protective hearing devices worn for medical reasons by passengers or protective purposes by crew is not
considered unsafe and IS permitted during boarding, deplaning, taxi, take-off, descent or landing.

749 / 845

11.1.18 CUSTOMER SERVICE DEFINED
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

Excellent customer service is not simply meeting the needs of the customer, it is “consistently exceeding” the needs
of the customer.
The following information is meant to assist you in helping Air Tindi achieve our goal of “exceeding” the needs of our
valued customers.

750 / 845

11.1.19 CODE OF CONDUCT
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

At all times when on duty, you are to avoid any conduct, which could give our passengers and the general public the
impression of rudeness, indifference, immaturity or lack of self-confidence and discipline.
You are to be courteous, pleasant, attentive and cooperative with our customers, other company personnel, and agencies
representing the company and with airport inspection services personnel. Assume an air of friendliness but avoid being
over-familiar with any one individual.

751 / 845

11.1.20 CONVERSATIONS IN THE PRESENCE OF PAX AND PUBLIC
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

Your conversations in the presence of our passengers and the general public should, at all times, display a business-like
tone. The following will not be tolerated:
Unguarded conversations and comments on airline and security related issues
Excessive small talk, controversial discussions, sacrilegious stories, political, racial or military movements
False, slanderous or derogatory statements about the company, its employees or patrons, passengers or about
other airlines or their personnel
The use of slang and the manner of appearing tough, bossy or of giving orders to anyone
Responding to a foolish or irrelevant question with flippancy or in an argumentative manner
Remember, that subjects which may be commonplace to airline personnel, may be misunderstood or misinterpreted
by outsiders and also prove to be harmful to the security and reputation of both the company and its crewmembers.

752 / 845

11.1.21 ATTITUDE
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

In aviation, it is not only your aptitude that will determine your altitude, but it is also your attitude.
Job performance is not only measured by your ability to accomplish tasks, but also by the attitude you exhibit towards
your work. Your attitude has a direct bearing on your life’s work, your home environment and the goals you establish.
Look for the good in people. Everyone has qualities that make him or her unique. Your behavior and attitudes are
reflected back to you through mirrored responses.
That is, people tend to treat others the way they themselves have been treated. It’s the old “golden rule” if you want to
be treated with respect then you must extend the same respect to those with whom you come into contact.
A positive attitude is probably the most effective tool in handling any kind of situation. Use it to your advantage on the
aircraft to turn a negative atmosphere into a good one, and to make a good atmosphere even better.
Sometimes the negative side of an issue is the most obvious. Always challenge yourself to find positive solutions. You will
come away with a much better feeling of accomplishment, and it leaves others with a favorable impression of you as a
person, a flight attendant, and a representative of Air Tindi. A positive attitude about your job stems from an unselfish
desire to please people.
A positive attitude is the key that unlocks the door to being open-minded, flexible, self-accepting, creative, empathetic and
motivated. Your work and lifestyle in general, for that matter, becomes less complicated when you take pleasure in the
things you do and the people you meet. Knowing how to apply a sense of humor in appropriate situations and a
willingness to learn new systems is a mark of maturity that will add to your self-esteem.
The zest and excitement that you generate in your professional and personal life have a way of affecting those around
you. Passengers and co-workers like to be associated with a high achiever and a happy individual. For you, there are the
rewards of self-confidence and a sense of accomplishment. Enthusiasm can be habit forming thus influencing your mental
and emotional point of view. A positive attitude and enthusiasm also help you to achieve those goals and objectives you
value as most important in your life. Remember it’s “your” attitude that will determine “your” altitude and you are surely
encouraged to “shoot for the stars”.

11.1.22 PASSENGER RELATIONS
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

The proper handling of passengers is an art in itself. In fact, working with people in any line of business calls forth all of
your ability and tactfulness. We must rely on your personality and disposition a great deal, and can only give you a few
suggestions. The points to follow will be a great help in guiding you toward the goal of keeping our valued customers
happy.
The four Goods will take you further than anything else: Good nature, Good service, Good humor and Goodwill.
A good flight attendant gives fast, dependable service coupled with uniformity, alertness and intelligence.
Anticipate, insofar as possible, the passenger’s wants or needs. Herein lies the secret of a great F/A. For example,
if you see a passenger restlessly looking around the aircraft or out the window, approach him / her offering a
beverage or newspaper. Always fulfill a request as quickly as possible.
You will encounter a variety of personalities in your passengers. No two people are alike. There will be differences in
ages, social position, first time flyers, people on business trips, vacationers, tourists, military personnel, etc. For
instance, a person travelling for the first time will welcome any information you may have. On the other hand, a
passenger travelling for business will probably prefer a quiet, comfortable trip which will give him / her a chance to
do some work inflight.
The degree of success of the F/A depends on the interest he / she takes in their work, their company and how their
work is applied. Air Tindi is in the business of handling people and you as F/A’s are our representative’s and
ambassadors. Consequently, we want enthusiastic people working for us. This enthusiasm will spread and grow
among those with whom you come in contact with.
Pay particular attention to inexperienced or first time flyers. If they appear nervous, engage them in conversation to
distract them from fear.
Retain your composure at all times. A quiet smiling manner tends to promote the comfort and ease of your
passengers. You must realize that there are still some people who are not completely won over to the airplane
(especially some of our first nation clients). Psychologically speaking, therefore, they are twice as susceptible to any
mood that could be mistaken as fear. Rushing about the cabin may give them the mistaken impression that there is
something wrong with the aircraft.
During boarding and deplaning the reverse of #7 is true. An atmosphere of alertness and efficiency is desirable. The
passenger comes to the airport in a hurry to be off on his or her trip, and it is a hard blow to their plans when they
see a lackadaisical atmosphere around the aircraft. You will find that a precise routine will aid you in helping to get
your flight off on time;
Look directly at the passenger when you speak to him / her. Project your voice to be heard over the engine noise. If
a passenger has trouble hearing you, raise your voice, enunciate clearly and or speak toward his / her ear if
necessary.
Keep passengers informed of updated arrival times as often as you can. You need not be reminded that people who
use air travel are generally in a hurry and are therefore, extremely interested in arrival times. A good way to inform
several people at one time is to pick a friendly face and simply state to them your updated arrival time, in a voice
loud enough so that people several rows behind and in front also hear.

754 / 845

Never balance yourself by holding onto the seatback’s when walking down the aisle, use the overhead bins instead.
Passengers riding on a non-revenue pass will receive no more or no less attention than revenue passengers. Be
extremely careful not to pay more attention to NRs than regular passengers.
Remember, your showing goodwill will take you very far. If a passenger says thank you, for goodness sakes say
you’re welcome or something similar to acknowledge their thanks. Plain everyday good manners are essential.
A grouch can usually be won over through cheerful, open attention. In fact, you might try a little extra attention and a
little extra effort at pleasing such a person.
Never argue with a passenger or with other crewmembers in front of the passengers.
Avoid flippancy both in manner and remarks.
Cultivate the habit of saying “I believe” or “it seems” rather than making positive or emphatic statements;
Always keep up on current events. Know your subject, but never be afraid to admit you don’t know something. If a
passenger asks something regarding the flight that your are unable to answer, explain that you do not know but will
try to find out for them.
Be a good listener. However, don’t offer solutions or suggestions to the individuals problems.
Never put a passenger on the spot. If a passenger embarrasses you or is rude, simply ignore it. Excuse yourself and
walk away.
Retain your composure under any circumstances. Quiet, smiling composure and thoughtful efficiency, promote good
passenger relations.
To create a personalized atmosphere, always try to call each passenger by name. Otherwise, use Sir or Ma’am.
Never make remarks or gestures that could be considered risqué. Avoid any conversation that could be risqué. Most
passes or improper behavior can be nipped in the bud by the manner in which your project yourself. You will
probably not be approached inappropriately by anyone if you do not project in that manner.
The three controversial subjects that must always be avoided with the passengers are politics, religion and racial
subjects. You are representing Air Tindi and any opinion you give on any of those subjects could be misconstrued as
a company position. These are very sensitive subjects and should be avoided, if a passenger brings one up, change
the subject.

Should a passenger ask you about your flying experiences, never relay your hairier moments or thrilling
experiences. Emphasize the routine nature of air travel, and refer to bad weather as a routine problem in our area.
Be as matter of fact about bad weather conditions as you can. Make it clear that our policy is to fly when we can do
so safely, but there are times when we simply will not attempt a landing.
The “customer is always right” is not true all the time. Any passenger who interferes with your ability to perform your
duties or endangers the safety of flight has violated his / her privileges and respect as a passenger. You as a F/A are
free to correct and or to discipline such a passenger, using utmost discretion, to ensure that the person does not
disturb other passengers or endanger the safety of the flight. Don’t be afraid to the use the word “no” if necessary.

11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

I am the customer who goes into the restaurant, sits down and patiently waits while the waitresses do everything but take
my order.
I am the customer who goes into a department store and stands quietly by while the sales clerks ignore me and continue
with their chitchat.
I am the customer who drives into a gasoline service station and never blows my horn, but waits patiently while the
attendant finishes reading his / her comic book.
Yes you might say I am the good customer! But do you know who else I am?
I am the customer who never comes back and who will tell others not to go to your place of business, and it
amuses me to see companies spending thousands of dollars every year to get me into their place of business, when I
was there in the first place; and all you had to do to keep me was to give me some time, attention, customer service
and common courtesy.

11.1.24 SOME THINGS TO THINK ABOUT
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE

If your memory is poor, develop a system to help you
Never in your life say “it’s not my job”
Read your job description but do not be restricted by it
Show initiative and do what needs to be done as a common courtesy to your fellow co-workers (keeping in mind that
you must have received proper training on equipment etc)
Be known as someone who enhances customer service
Maintain a sense of adventure – there are things to do if your travels take you to Cambridge Bay in February –
remember the “right attitude”
Never appear stressed in front of a customer
Take a deep breath and ask yourself, in the course of human events, how important is this?

11.1.25 INFLIGHT SERVICE // GENERAL
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

The method of serving passengers changes from flight to flight depending upon the clientele and specific inflight service
provisions requested by the customer. However, the means of presentation should remain the same. The following
procedures are written to maintain consistency when providing inflight service, and to ensure the customers encounter
with Air Tindi is always an enjoyable experience.
Great service always begins with a smile, so smile! Besides a smile is the greatest accessory that anyone could wear.
All service will commence from the forward of the cabin to the aft. Pax in window seats are served first, however “ladies
first” still applies.

11.1.26 EYE CONTACT
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

Eye contact is very important between all crew members and also with the passengers. For instance, when a F/A is
working in the buffet / galley area they should periodically be looking towards the cabin to see if the other F/A’s providing
service are in need of having any of their service items replenished or topped up. Occasionally, the call button could be
utilized to gain the attention of the F/A in the buffet / galley, but it should not be practiced on a regular basis. Our goal is to
ensure our customers have an enjoyable flight experience and not be inundated by the sound of continuous call chimes.
Eye contact with the passengers is equally important. It is effective when offering any service or additional amenities such
as pillows, blankets, newspapers and so on. You should make it a habit to look for the eye contact of the pax before
asking the question, “would you care for a newspaper” etc.
When moving through the cabin for regular monitoring checks, you should also be looking at the pax. Most of the time as
you know, it is a safety oriented check, since you are constantly assessing the pax and are required to be alert to any
potential problems. However, during the course of these checks perhaps a pax may request a beverage or other service
item. Acknowledge the pax and tend to their service request expediently.

760 / 845

11.1.27 SPECIAL REQUESTS and MEDICAL CONDITIONS
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

If a pax is to request water or juice, please tend to their request as soon as possible, as you may be unaware of a medical
condition. Also, if by a chance you have a pax who requests a snack before you are offering snacks to the other pax’s,
please see to it that the pax receives it right away. As again, this pax could be a diabetic and they know when they need
to eat something to stave off any additional problem.

761 / 845

11.1.28 CHILDREN and INFANTS
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

Ensure children are served first with a beverage of their choice as this will immediately keep them occupied while you are
serving the other pax’s.
For adults travelling with infants, coordinate with them when the best time would be to eat, so they can take turns eating.
If pax have dirty diapers, advise them to place them in a sick bag and then dispose of the sick bag into the lavatory waste
receptacle.

762 / 845

11.1.29 SANITATION AND HEALTH CONSIDERATIONS
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

As a flight attendant, you play an important role in hygiene, food preservation and protection. Maintaining proper storage
and temperature levels is the key to preventing spoilage and contamination.
Keep commissary container doors closed when not in use
Pay strict attention to your personal hygiene when involved in food and beverage service
Ensure before handling any food that you have washed your hands
According to appearance standards and health laws, long hair should be secured so as not to fall forward of the face
and shoulders
Preferably, do not sneeze or cough near pax’s and especially around food items
Immediately wash your hands after sneezing, after using the lavatory and before proceeding with any additional
service
Place garbage in proper containers and keep work surfaces clean and organized
Do not store chemical cleaning products in any food serving / storage drawers / containers
Do not store tools or a/c parts in any food serving / storage drawers / containers
Verify all food items for any visible signs of bacteria or mould and expiry dates
For sanitation purposes, use available tools and utensils in handling all food and beverage items
For instance, use a pair of tongs for putting ice in glasses
Do not handle glasses by their rims and only use clean utensils
Hold silverware by its handles
If you drop a utensil, put it to the side and use a clean one
Discard any food item that drops to the floor, even if a shortage will result from the loss of it
If a pax’s table tray appears dirty or something spills on it, wipe it off with a clean towel as soon as possible.

763 / 845

11.1.30 INFLIGHT PROVISIONS
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

When providing inflight service provisions, for example when offering newspapers and you are going row by row and
asking “would you care for a newspaper”, it is not always necessary to ask each pax individually. You could ask one pax,
and have eye contact with the other pax’s. If interested, they will usually extend their hand to obtain the newspaper. If
they choose not to look your way that would generally indicate that they are not interested. Usually at least one person in
a row will acknowledge your presence, if not, move onto the next row.

764 / 845

11.1.31 BEVERAGE SERVICE
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

Our beverage service can vary from basic such as coffee, tea, juice and water which is offered on most flights, to a very
diverse selection of beverages including alcohol depending upon what the customer requests.
Ensure the pax always receives a beverage napkin, this includes when serving bottled water
This will also help with the next flight. As new pax board they are more likely to have a clean table tray at their
seating area. It would be quite offensive for you to board an aircraft, sit down and lower your tray only to find coffee
or pop stains on your tray. We want to present a more professional image than that.
Beverage napkins help in the prevention of stains
Always wipe away spills you notice when carrying out service.

765 / 845

11.1.32 COFFEE AND TEA SERVICE
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

When serving hot beverages, make sure they are just that HOT. No one is more disappointed than a person who asks for
a cup of coffee and receives a lukewarm one instead (particularly in our arctic climate).
If offering “tray” coffee service, ensure the tray is stocked with plenty of cream, sugar, artificial sweetener and stir sticks.
As a safety precaution, never pour liquids (hot or cold) into a pax cup if it is sitting on their table tray, in their hand or over
a seat back. Request that the cup be placed on the serving tray and pour the liquid in the “aisle” on the tray.

766 / 845

11.1.33 MEAL TRAY SERVICE
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

When serving meals, no more than 2 trays are to be carried at one time. For pick-up, no more than 5 are to be carried. If
more than these are carried at one time, it looks sloppy and unprofessional.

(Reference Chapter 2 entitled General Service Procedures and Flight Deck Service)

11.1.34 COLLECTING CABIN GARBAGE
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

If you have any concerns for the potential of contacting germs when collecting the pax’s drinks, meal trays or other
refuse, then don protective gloves prior to doing so, otherwise wash your hands thoroughly following cleanup.
Allow the pax’s enough time to enjoy their meal or beverage and then commence with a cleanup; however
Garbage should never be sitting on the pax’s trays for an extended period of time, you can be collecting garbage
during your regular cabin checks.
Esthetically, it is preferred that all refuse be collected using a “hard surface” tray and then disposed of into a waste
container.
Sanitize the tray after using it for this purpose
If there is an excessive amount of refuse to be collected, you are allowed to use a garbage bag to conduct the
cleanup.
If the meal provisions are not in a disposable container, place the full tray back into the designated storage
container.
All garbage must be removed from the cabin at the next station stop or at the end of the days flying.
Never leave garbage on board overnight.

769 / 845

11.1.35 QUALITY CONTROL
11. MISCELLANEOUS & CUSTOMER SERVICE
11.1 Miscellaneous & Customer Service

Communication is an effective part of inflight service. Since F/A’s are the ones who most often hear the passengers
comments regarding the service, it is your responsibility to relay these comments to the Flight Attendant Manager.
Utilize the cabin operations form to convey any feedback (good or bad) received from the customers.
